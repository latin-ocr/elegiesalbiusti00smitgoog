Propert. 4, 5,9; Lucan, 6, 431³ Seneca, Medea, 6753 Macheth's address to
the witches (4, 1, 52), etc. All these references to witchcrait in Tibullus,
as well as in other Roman poets, are regularly cited as authority hy the writers
on magic, Remigius, Rudinus, de l’Ancre, le Loyer, Delrio, and others of their
kind, [τοττι the fifteenth rothe eighteenth century. The use oi.anaphora is
notable and sounds like the woman's own advertisement; cp. 1, 2, 30 and 1,
1, 23, etc.

43-52. Imitated by Sannazaro, Arcadia, p. 168, ed. Scherillo (Milan, 1888).

43. The poet refers to ‘drawing down the moon'; cp. 1, 8, 21, the most
famousandpicturesque charmin all antiquity. It is mentioned first by
Aristoph. Nubes, 749, again and again by later writers, and still survives in
modern Greeee. Menander made use of it ior literary purposes in his com·
edy the Thettale (Pliny, H.N. 30, 7), also Theokritos in his second Idyll and
Vergil in his eighth Eclogue. See, too, Lukian, Philopseudes, 14, and the
strange story in Apuleius, Met. 2, 32—3, 19. It was always a love charin and in
its origin distinctly associated with Thessaly, a land os magic and magieians
in the estimation of antiquity. Pindar says that Venus taught the charm to
Jason. ln the latertradition it is often associated with Medea. For a vase
painting of the process, see Roscher's Selene und Verwandtes, plate 3, and
sor the charm in ‘Theokritos and Vergil, M. Sutphen, Studies in Honoras
B. L. Gildersleeve, Baltimore‚1902, p. 315.—d11centem: ior the participle
with vidi, see 1, 4, 34.

44. Another stock illustration oi the power oi magic over the elements.
As the Moon, even against her will, must come down from heaven to make
the love charm work, so rivers can be made to run backwards (vertit). Cp.
Propert. 1, 1, 233 Ovid, Amor. 1, 8,6; 2,1,26; Verg. Α. 4, 489; Apoll.
Rhod. 3, 5 32, etc. The reason, however, for this particular seat is never given.

45-48. The magic ceremony mentioned here is nekyomantia, i.e. summon-
ing the spirits 01' the dead in order to make them prophesy or answer ques-
tions. The locus classicus is Lucan, 6, 419-830. Among the most famous
instances os its use as a literary motive are Homer, Odyssey, 11 ; Alschylos,
Persai (Ghost of Dareios) ; Lucan, l.c. (Sextus Pompeius before Thapsus);
1 Samuel, 28, 7 (Witch ot' Endor); Shakespeare, Macheth, 4, 1. Laberius
also wrote a mimus called Necyomantia. The subject was much discussed by
cultivated people in Cicero's time. Among those who actually practised it
may be mentioned Vatinius (Cicero, Vat. 14), Libo Drusus (Tacitus, Ann.
