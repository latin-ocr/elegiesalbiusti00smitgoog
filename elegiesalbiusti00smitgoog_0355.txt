1, 8, ³²] TlBVLLVS

‘olim etiam ne prima genas anugo nitentes Ι spargeret) The ordinary word
for smoth-laced boys was glabri, cp. Catull. 61, 1353 Mart. 4, 28, etc.

The appearance of the heard was fatal to the vogue of person like
Marathus, and hence is often mentioned in the poetry devoted to his kind, cp.
Antb.Pal.12, ro; 213 25-27; 31 ; 36, etc.

32. Α detail more frequently referred to in everydaylife than in literary art,
cp., however, Theokrit. ις, 130 (we should expect it in this sphere), οὐ κεντεῖ
τὸ φίλημ’, ἔτι oi περὶ χείλεα πυρρά (of Adonis).—amplexus: sc. treos=te
amplectentem. For the figure cp. 1, 2, 11 n.‚ and eg. Ovid, Fast. 3, 496,
⁸ amplexus inquinat illa tuos.’

Note that here as often the pentameter simply amplifies and emphasizes the
hexameter by restating the thought in the negative, cp. Introd. p. 102 and note
on1,1‚44. '

33. huic: 1, 2, 83 end note.

34. More or less proverbial, cp. Hor. 0ιί. 3, 9, 1, ‘donec gratus eram
tibi Ι nec qnisquam potior bracchia candidae Ι cervici iuvenis dabat, Ι Persa·

· rum vigui rege beatior’3 2, 12, 213 Mart. 2, 53, 103 Sappho, frag. 84 Crus.;

Anth. Pal. 11, 33 Aristainet. 1, 103 Hybrias, p. 275, Crus.; etc. 2
35. Pholoe, who isjealously guarded in the rrsual way (cp. 55 f. below) by

her ‘canus amator‚’ had made it the real or imaginary excuse for her failure to ι

turn up at various times and places appointed (61-66). This line, really a
brief statement of the boy’s own complaint (55-60), which is the foundation
of it, is supposed to be a reply to her excuses, while the following lines
(35-38), designed especially for a person of her temperament and position,
are meant to emphasize as much as possible all that she loses by yielding to
her fears or her caprices as the case may be.-at Venus: 1, 3, 58 n.; 4, 7, 4 n.
-lnveniet succumbere: a Greek construction, cp. eg. Soph. 0. T. 120,
ἓν γὰρ πόλλ’ dv ἐξεύροι μαθεῖν. -succumberez ὑποκλίκσθαι, cp. substernere.
Note that this is a drastic popular word, often used, for example, of animab,

cp. Varro, De Re Rust. 2, ιο, 9; Mart. 13, 64, ι, 14, 2015 Petron. 126;

Ovid, Fast. 2, 810; etc.

3⁶. tumet: cp. Priap. 83, 43 (sometimes attributed to Tib.), ‘et in·
quietus inguina arrigat tumor’; Hor. Sat. 1, 2, 116, 'tument tibi cum
ingnina,’ etc.; 2, 7, 49, ‘turgentis verbera caudae’; Verg. G. 2, 324; etc.
—ooneerlh rie. consero consevi. This agricultural metaphor‚ inherent in
both Greek and Latin from the first, is not infrequent in this connection, cp.
Lucret. 4, 1105, ‘denique cum membris collatis flore fruuntur Ι aetatis, iam
cum praesagit gaudia corpus Ι atque in eost Venus ut muliebria conserat
arva, Ι adfigunt avide corpus iunguntque salivas Ι oris et inspirent pressantes
dentibus ora,’ etc.; Eurip. Phoeniss. 18 (the qraele to Laios), d δ’ εἶπεν· ὦ
