TIBVLLVS

In other words, Tibullus's object in choosing the girl was to
‘get even ' with Delia, and in christening her Nemesis he meant to
indicate that in his case she was the mortal instrument of the great
goddess of balance and of even-handed justice. If s0, he found —
as many others have found —that his instrument of vengeance was
something of a boomerang.

As a successful courtesan of the higher class Nemesis is a young
person vastly superior to her predecessor in tenacity of purpose
and single-hearted devotion to the main chance. She has no illu-
sions, is not impressed by poetry, and does not enjoy sentiment.
Her tastes are expensive, and she'expects the poet to gratify thenr,
or else to cease from absorbing her valuable time. In short she is
the regular rapax meretrix of comedy, and the poet is her usual
lover. He is forever complaining of his bondage, and of her greed,
heartlessness, and infidelity-all stock themes, but, like the char-
acters themselves, too common in daily life to warrant the assump-
tion that the poet’s inspiration is purely literary.

In the first elegy (2, 3) of the series Nemesis has left town
with her wealthy lover, and is now at his country place taking part
in the merriment of the vintage season. The poet was not invited,
but feels that he must go. This abject attitude however which
runs through the entire group, and which we have already observed
in one scene (1, 5) of the affair with Delia, is especially prominent
in the following elegy (2, 4). This piece has been termed amere
verse exercise after the Alexandrian manner. I should agree
with Mr. Postgate that as an expression of genuine feeling it has
no equal in the work of Tibullus. Such however is subjective
criticism.

‘F arewell forever‚' he begins, ‘to my former freedom. My fate
is sealed. My lot is a bitter bondage and every torture which
Love the slave-driver can invent. Oh, to lose the power of feel-
ing such agonies as mine how gladly would I be a stone on some
icy peak, or stand a beetling crag towering immovable against

the tempestuous winds and angry seas. As it is my days are
