amator, with its well-worn illustration of the ianua or house door, cp. ι, 1, 733

73. That is, ‘erat nulla ianua dolentes exclusura' The future participle is
the attribute of ianua (1, 9, 9, n.). ‘There was no watchman then, no door
destined to,' etc. .

74. moe ille: for ille with the vocative, cp. isin 2, 3, 33 ιι.

75. The thought of the missing hexameter may be restored with afair de·
gree of certainty. It seems clear that 76 qualified 75 in the same way that 70
does 69, and that 78 does 77, i.e. in each case adisadvantage isset over
against an advantage. 'Further, 76, the raiment of primitive man, is con·
trasted with 78, the dress of the modern exquisite. The missing 75, therefore,
ought to be a contrast with 77. The contrast with 77 is practically the
thought of 73-74. The thought, therefore, of the missing line was doubtless
a recapitulation of 73-74-and this, moreover, is avery common device
with our poet.

78. laxam togam: on this habit of the ultra-fashionable Roman, see 1, 6,
40n. Asharp contrast with 76 is intended. The rude garments of primaeval
man, with love satisfied (75-76), are better than the most fashionable clothes
of to·day, with love thwarted. The logicis that of 32 above, and the argu-
ment upon which' rt rests is that, for instance, of 1, 2, 75 f.

Tibullus describes and deplores his misery as a lover of Nemesis. He
pictures himself as the slave ofa degrading passion for an utterly unworthy
object and as keenly alive to the fact. See Introd. p. 54.

‘Farewell forever to my former freedom. My fate is sealed. Α bitter
bondage is my lot, and every tortura which Love the slave-driver can invent.
Oh, to lose the power of feeling such agonias as mine how gladly would I be
