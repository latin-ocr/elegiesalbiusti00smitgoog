r, 5, 1] TIBVLLVS

1,5

Tibullus and Delia have been separated 101 some time in consequence 01 a
serious quarrel. Now he longs 101 a reconciliation at any price. Meanwhile,
however, Delia has yielded to the more substantial arguments 01 a rich lover.
See Introd. p.·47.

‘ I said in my pride that our parting meant nothing 10 100. Ipray you have
mercy upon me, 1 have been hitterly pnnished. Remember when youwere

ill how I prayed 101 your recovery. Alas, a rival now reaps the benefit 01 my
prayers. Ι had looked lorward 10 a happy life together when you would join
me in welcoming Messalla to our country home. All that was only an idle
dream. I turned to the wine cup, but sorrow changed the draught to tears.
I turned to other loves, but the thought 01 you 1011 010 cold. It is the rich
lover and his agent the cunning bawd that have been my ruin. May the
curse 01 bestial madness hound her shrielriug and loamiug to a pauper's
gravei Have done with her, Delia, and with her advice. Love and gilts
' cannot live together. Itis the poor lover, not the rich one, that reuders you
the tribute 01 service and devotion. Aias, l sing in vain. Her door has no
ears except 1011110 chink 01 gold. But you, you, I say, who just now are the
better marr, look 101 my late. The wheel 01 Fortuue is never still. Indeed,
another man is already loitering about your door a great deal, dodging baclr
and 101111, sauntering up and down, clearing his throat noisily from time to
time. Surely he has reasons 10111. Something is 00 1001. Make the most
01 your opportunities while you may. Yon are sailing iu smooth seasl

1-6. The slave 01 Cupid cannot escape 11010 his bondage. The rebel learns
by bitter experience that many waters cannot quench love and that pride
goeth before a sall. Another illustration 01 the erotic poet’s maxim that Iove
isan invincible and a jealous god: see 1, 3, 21-22; 1, 2, 89-96 and notes;
cp. also 2, 6, 5; Propert. 2, 2, l; 3,11, 13 Philodem. Anth. Pal. 5, 24, and 101
an amusing variant, Terence, Eun. 57. Ovid deals at large with this theme,
Rem. Amor. 53. Contrast his mock solemnity with the passionate fervor ο1
Catull. 76.

r. For the lorce 01 1110 imperiects cp. ao and 355 2, 5, 21.

i.e. ‘boastlul assumption ol courage! ‘I said in my haste,’ ete.

3-4. Children’s games are usually 01 immemorial antiquity. For example,
two young 1000, 000 whipping a top (βέμβιξ) are pictured on au Attie drinlr·
