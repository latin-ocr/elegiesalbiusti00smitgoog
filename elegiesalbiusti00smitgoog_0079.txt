TIBVLLVS

cussed at great length, but to which it is no longer possible to give
a definite answer.
The first section of this series of miscellaneous poems is by an
ss author who calls himself Lygdamus (3, 2, ²9)· It consists of
six elegies addressed to ‘ N caera! We conclude that the two had
once been married or betrothed (1, ²3 ; 4, 60), but that after-
ward she was alienated from him. He however has always loved
her, and longs for a reconciliation. The poems are technically
correct, and throw considerable light on society in the Augustan
Age. They also indicate a man of rare generosity, tendemess,
and refinement of feeling 3 we rnay grant, too, that criticism of bis
art has certainly been too severe ; but it must be acknowledged that
we have here the work of an amateur, and one whose character as
aman was superior to his genius as a poet. He follows Tibullus
closely in both matter and form, and the mere presence of his ’
poems in this collection is in itself aproof that he was in some way
connected with the circle of Messalla. ¹
His identity however is a puzzle. ¹ If his real name was Lygdamus,
he was of servile extraction, doubtless a learned freedman of the
house of Messalla, and we should have a foundation for Mr. Post-
¹ gate’s suggestion that he was the editor of the Appendix malliano.
This however is by no means necessary. As a man of good
family-and surely this is the implication of r, aand 6, 59-60- Χ
he would, like the Demophobn and the Lynceus of Pr0pertius ἶ
(ag. 2, 22, 2: 2, 34, 9), prefer to conceal his identity under a
pseudonym. That this was probably the case is further shown by
the fact that Neaera herself is of good family (4, 91 f. 3 2, 11).
As such she could hardly have been betrothed, much less married,
toa man whose real name was Lygdamus.

· He states, orso at least the lines are usually interpreted, that he
was born in the year or possibly on the day that both consuls fell
at Modena, tle. 43 rac. This effectually disposes of theold
theory that Lygdamus = the youthful Tibullus, but at the same
time introduces a problem for which no man can offer a satisfactory
