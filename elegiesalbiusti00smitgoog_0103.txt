follows the lead of the hexameter in the direction of greater
lightness. In the matter of the schemata, i.e. the four possible

 

combinations of dactyls and spondees in the first two feet, the ἱ

Romans emphasized especially the Alexandrian fondness for DS,
and increased the proportion of DD at the expense of the other
two. ln other words in the pentameter, as in the hexameter,
there was a growing fondness for a dactyl in the first foot.

But the most striking development of the Roman pentameter as
opposed to the Greek is the so-called law of the dissyllable, i.e.
the rapidly growing tendency which finally became fixed to end
the verse with an iambic word. For the Greeks there was more
freedom here than in the cadence of the hexameter, and there was
also no marked chronological development. The favourites are
words of two, three, or four syllables, and usage is about equally
divided. Monosyllables were not liked, but otherwise the choice
ofa word here appears to have been determined largely by con·
venience. Words of five, six, or seven syllables are less common
here, but they are also less common in the language itself.

Turning now to Latin we find that Catullus, as usual, was fol-
lowing the Greeks, but there is already a decided tendency to the
dissyllable. Note too that the tendency is more marked in bis
elegy than in his epigram. This difference‚ though less marked in

later times, was one that always remained. As compared with ’

Catullus, the work of Tibullus shows an enormous increase in favour
of the dissyllable. The difference however between the first and
second book is too slight to warrant the conclusion that he would
have gone farther in this direction if he had lived. The notable
freedom of Propertius in the first three books, which reminds one
of Catullus andprobably brackets him in this respect with Gallus,
indicates inexperience ora subsequent change of beart. At all
events in his last elegies, written some years later, it has practi-

cally disappeared. Lygdamus, as usual, follows Tibullus. With ,

Ovid the law of the dissyllable finally became fixed.
Many regret the establishment of this rule. They see in the
