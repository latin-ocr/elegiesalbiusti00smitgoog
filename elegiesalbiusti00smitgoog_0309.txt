Pliny, 8, 833 etc), especially, however, the food snatched from his jaus ]

(Lucan, 6, 552) or frons the jaws of a hungry dog (Hor. Epod. 5, 23).
The child who drinks dog’s milk shall later bark like a dog (Ovid, Ibis, 169).
and in Modern Greece, where, owing to Slavonian influence, werewolf and
vampire are combined in one, the person who eats a lamb killed hy a wolf
shall afterwards, become a vampire. So here the lena, driven to gnaw bones
covered with the slaver of an uncanny beast whose mad hunger and fury are
a proverb (Aristoph. Lysist. 629; Diogen. Paroem. Graeci 6, 20, and often),

finally comes as a matter of course to wolf-madness, or lycanthropy, for this Ϊ

is plainly the affiiction alluded to in 55. Hence tbe dogs (sacred to Hekate,
who was once her patron goddess, but who now leads the ghosts against her)

recognize her as something uncanny and hunt her from the crosa-roads before r
sbe can find time to devour the offering of food to Hekate (Ἑκάτης δεῖπνον, ,

see my Hekate’s Suppers in Hastings' ‘Cyclop of Religion and Ethics,’ s.v., and
cp. Aristoph. Plus. 596 and Schol.; Petron. 1353 Lulrian, Dial.Mort.1,1‚
etc). So at last shall be fulfilled the curse of the dead lovers. It was fore-
ahadowed by the strix, it begins to work in 53, and through the agencies of

5 3-54 it finally culminates in lycanthropy, the most dramatic if not the most ἒ

awful of all the forms of madness. This disease, which still occurs bere and
there, was widely prevalent in the days of the witch trials and not at all un-
common in antiquity. References to it are numerous and all agree with

Marcellus Sidetes, a physician of the second century who wrote a special work ¹

on the subject, that persons so afflicted wander by night in lonely places,
about graves, eto, and howl like wolves. Like all forms of madness, it was
traced to Hekate and the unquiet dead; cp. 1311.

57-58. This staccato style is very characteristic of ovid, cp. Amor. 2, 4,
35, ‘haec habilis brevitate sua est, corrumpor utraque: Ι conveniunt voto
longa brevisque meo, Ι nonest culta: subit, quid cultae accedere possit.

57. esculat, etc: for the same nalve type of summam, 1, 7, 5 ; 2, 1, 25.

58. iniusta lege: ‘unfain’ because the hond was mutual and therefore
should be dissolved onlyby mutual consent, cp. ι, 2, 63; 1, 5,7n. Venusis
angry with the perjured party because the oath was taken in her name. The
whole passage is really a parable fo'r Delia's benefit. This indirect method
of reproof is, as we have already seen, very characteristic of Tibullus.

59. sagae rapacia: ele. the lena of 483 the two trades went together. She

is now urging the cause of the dives amator, and her praecepta form an im·
portant and characteristic though most unlovely topic of the elegy.
