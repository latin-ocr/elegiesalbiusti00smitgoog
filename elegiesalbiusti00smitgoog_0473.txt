The particular comet here referred to is probably the famous ⁴ Stella Crinita,'
the ‘Stat of Caesar’ (see Vergil, E. 9, 46 and A. 8, 681, with the notes of
Servius; Horace, Od. 1, 12, 47), the appearance of which in July of 44 coin·
cided with the first celebration by Octavianus of the Ludi Veneris Genetricis
in commemoration of Caesar's death. Pliny, 2, 93, quotes the words of
Octavianus himself with regard to it, cp. also Obsequens, 68;- Sueton. Iul.

¹ 88; Plutarch, Caes. 68; Cassius Dio, 45, 17, 4. Vergil, G. 1, 487 implies
more than one comet, and so Pliny, 2, 933 Manil. 1, 907. There were also an
unusual number of faces, λαμπάδες, r'.e. shooting stars, cp. Ovid, Met. 15, 787.
One in particular is mentioned by Cassius Dio, 45, 17, 4 (cp. Obsequens,
68). Α similar comet appeared before Pharsalia (Pliny, l.c.) and this too was
accompanied by shooting stars (Petron. 122, 1395 Lucan, 1, 526).

72. Showers of stones on this occasion seem to be mentioned elsewhere
only by Appian, B. C. 4, 4, 14. The portent, not infrequent in volcanic
Italy, is osten mentioned by Livy and others. The Senate usually decreed a
novemdiale-ut deplueret: sc. stare. On the displacement of que see 1,1,
40 n. depluere is rare-lapis: for this collective singular with multra cp.
1, 1, 42 n.; 1, 3, 28n.; 1, 4, 76; 1, 9, 68n.; 2, 3, 4²·

73. At this point the poet drops the cons. with dixerunt and with it all
direct reference to the Sibyls and proceeds with serunt, ‘it is reported that:
etc. The shift in the point of view both here and at 75-76 is natural and
dramatic. lt is not implied of course that only the first two portents were
foreseen by the Sibyls, but only that in the excitement os telling the story of
these famous portents the poet ceases aster the first two lines to emphasize
the connection of the Sibyls with them.

This dreadsul portent was generally reported, cp. Verg. G. 1, 474, ‘armorum

sonitum toto Germania caelo Ι audiit, insolitis tremuerunt motibus Alpes’3
Ovid, Met. 15, 783, ‘arma serunt inter nigras crepitantia nubes Ι terribilesque
tubas auditaque cornua caelo Ι praemonuisse nefas '3 Appian, B. C. 4, 4, 14,
ἀνδρῶν τε μεγάλαι βοαὶ καὶ κτύπος ὅπλων καὶ δρόμος ἵππων οὐχ ὁρωμένων
ἠκούετο· Obsequens, 69 (Livy), ‘C. Pansa A. Hirtio consulibus . . . armorum
telorumque species aterra visa cum fragore ad caelum fieri,’ cp. Plutarch,
Caes. 63, which reappears in Shakespeare's J. C. 2, 2, as-

Fierce fiery warrions fought upon the clouds

In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol:

The noise of battle hurtled in the air,

Horses did neigh aud dying men did groatn

Ι The same portent occurred before Pharsalia, cp. Obsequens, 653 Petrou.
