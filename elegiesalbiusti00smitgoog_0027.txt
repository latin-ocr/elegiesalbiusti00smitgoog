mended to his distinguished pupil, as we leam from his Περὶ
Ἐρωτικῶν Παθημάτων, ‘ On the Missortunes ol Lovers,’ a little hand·
book addressed to Gallus and containing the bare plots oi a number
of such stories to be used by him in the composition os future
elegies.¹ Doubtiess Gallus employed this work in the manner
suggested. Possibly too his elegies, to judge srom the prevailing
mood of poetry at the time, were characterized by an idyllic strain
which would connect him directly or indirectly with the bucolic
poets ol Greece, but this is incapable ol definite proof.
Historically the elegy first enters Rome with the Hellenistic
epigram in distichs as cultivated by Catulus, ValeriusAedituus,
and their school at the end os the second century rac.2 Much more
important however was the impulse which came in the next
generation through Catullus Calvus, and the other νεώτεροι, under
the leadership of Valerius Cato. The surviving work os Catullus
shows his ability to write genuine elegies, and the lost poems of
Calvus to his Quintilla (threnodic),8 and the collection entitled
Leucadia (erotici‘) by Varro Atacinus suggest that Catullus was
· not the only representative of this department. The characteristic
work os the school however was really along other lines, and the
Roman critics were doubtless entirely justified in their view that
the real founder os their elegy as a great department os poetry was
Cornelius Gallus
. From what has been said above it will be seen that, taking the
elegy as a whole, the commanding figure in the department is
Mimnermos. His eroth-sentimental mood commended to the
Alexandrian Age by Antimachus becomes, when modified hythe
idyllic propensities os Philetas, the prevailing mood os the de-
. partment in later times. Every type however was cultivated in

lSee esp. Rohde, op. cit.. pp. 113 l. Gallus's method of using this material
was probably similar to that which we see iu Propertius.

and unlikely; see, eg.. frag. 17 M.. a pentameter. The position ol Quintilia or her
identity has no bearing on this question.
