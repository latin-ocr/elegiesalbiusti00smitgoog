T1BVLLVS

in professional grammarians and commentators, there appears to
be but one direct quotation [rom his works in the entire literature.
> This is made by Seneca (N. Q. 4, 2, 2=Tib. 1, 7, 26) and

evidently from memory, for he attributes the line to Ovid. That
aman so thoroughly conversant with the elegy could make this
particular mistake is in itsels an indication of that overshadowing
popularity ol Ovid which dated from the late Augustan Age, and
was destined to endure until well into the last century. lt is evi-
dent too that the class ol readers indicated by Quintilian's ‘sunt
qui Propertium malint' was well represented in the time olDo-
mitian. Evenin the metrical epitaphs mentioned above echoes of
the elegy are distributed in the significant ratio of Ovid, 125;
“ Propertius, 20 3 Tibullus, 12.

The status ol Tibullus in the reign ol the Antonines cannot
be determined with certainty. We leam from two poems (Anth.
Lat. 451-4'52) presumably written not far from this period that
the name itself of Delia had become a literary reminiscence.
This however is no prool of Tibullus’s popularity at the time.
One may s'pealr ol a ‘gay Lothario' without incurring the suspicion
of being acquaiuted with Nicholas Rowe even by name. The
second century was a bookish age, an age ol fine ,critical editions

κ and large professional interest in philological and antiquarian re-

‘ search Tm cultivated public talked much of books and authors,
and was especially interested in literary gossip. It is no accident
that the De Vr'n's Inlustribus, ‘The Lives os Distinguished Men,'
by Suetonius, an excellent scholar, and lor some years the private
secretary ol Hadrian, should belong to this age. The boolr con·
tained that life os Tibullus ol which the vitain our mss. is prob
ably a distant echo, and its appearance at that time doubtless
roused new interest in our poet. Many people however can con-
verse about a poet whom they have never read. The lact there-
fore that Apuleius can tell us who Delia really was is no sign in
itsell that Tibullus was still well known at first hand.

There are no notable echoes of him in the literature ol this
