nores [1‚4‚56

45) which the lover regularly olters to perform, cp. 4, 3, 11 ηις Oviu, Ars

Amat. 2, ¹893 Met. 1ο, 171; Plutarch, Mor. 52 B; Verg. E. 3, 74-75.
51-52. Cp. Plutarch, Mor. 58 Ε, who describes flatterers as regularly ὑποπίπ-

τοντες ἐν τῷ παλαίειν καὶ ἀπολειπόμενοι θεόντων. Cp. too the amusing advice

of Ovid, Ars Amat. 2, 203, and on sencing as an amusement, Cic. Sen. 58; ⁴

Manil. 4, ²27· Val. Max. 2, 3, 2, says that it was tirst introduced into the
army by the consul C. Rutilius. See also Ovid, Met. 10, 167-173; Nonnos,
10. 3393 πει-3615 ars-375³ 48.124s·; Ι59 f·

51. levi dextra: ‘with a light, easy hand,’ r'.e. try not to 'hit hard,’ cp. -
Lucret. 51067 (os dogs playing with their puppies), ‘et catulos blande cum
lingua lambere temptant Ι aut ubi eos iactant pedibus morsuque petentes Ι sus·
pensis teneros imitantur dentibus haustus.'—temptabis: cp. dabis, 52, the
future sor the imperative (not elsewhere in Tib.) reflects the tone of authority
cp., too, Gild.·Lodge, 243. '

53-56. Endure, then pity, then embrace. A favourite motive in the liter·
ature os kissing, Ovid, Ais Amat. 1, 663, ‘quis sapiens blandis non misceat
oscula verbis? Ι illa licet non det, non data sume tamen! Ι pugnabit primo
fortassis et “improbe” dicet: Ι pugnando vinci se tamen illa volet' ; Hor. Od.
2, 12, 25, ‘cum flagrantia detorquet ad oscula Ι cervicem aut sacili saevitia
negat, Ι quae poscente magis gaudeat eripi, Ι interdum rapere occupet!

54. oscula apta: Ovid, Her. 15, 130, ‘oscula . . . aptaque consueras accipere,
apta dare! These are the ‘close' kisses os the Elizabethan poets, cp. Paulus,
Ex Fert. 18, ‘aptus is qui convenienter alicui iunctus est! apta here isab-
solute; so 1, 7, 60, and occasionally in the poets.

55. rapta dabit: de. let you snatch them. On the other hand, Ovid, eg,
uses the same expression of the snatcher‚ cp. Amor. 2, 4, 26, ‘oscula cantanti
rapta dedisse velim'; Her. 15, 43, ‘cantabam memini (meminerunt omnia
amantem: Ι oscula cantanti tu mihi rapta dabas,’ ete. The participle is indefi-
nite. According to circumstances, it may mean ‘stolen from the subject,’ or
‘stolen by the subject.¹ The conditions however os a successful kiss are such
that the distinction between giving and receiving is more logical than real,
hence dare is regularly used of both in this connection. Strato (cp. Ante.
Pal. 12, 200, μισῶ δυσπερίληπτα φιλήματα, rel μαχιμώδεις Ι φωνάς) and doubt·
less others, do not prefer the type here mentioned. Others again are like the
girl in Saxe’s poem who would not kiss because-‘The maid if rightly
understood! Feels as any Christian maiden should: Ι She’d rather suller
wrong than do it.’ But while the point ol view may differ the result is rnuch
the same.

56. implicuisse: Neue-Wagener (3, 378) cites this pers. of implico from

Cicero, De Domo, 1053 Hortensius, frag. 9ο; Seneca, Epist. 22,'3; 75,11;
