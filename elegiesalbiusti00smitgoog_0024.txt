the Idylls os Theokritos who expressly states that he was the friend
aad pupil ol Philetas of Kos, distinguished as ateacher, Homericv
scholar, philologist, and philosopher, but more distinguished, we
may guess, as the founder and, with the possible exception of Kalli-
machos, as the greatest representative of the Hellenistic elegy.

In his elegiae poem Δημήτηρ, Philetas related the Rape ol
Persephone. A good idea of his probable style and method may
doubtless be gained from the charming stories os Hylas and ol
Polyphemos and Galatea told by Theokritos. Indeed, as Crusius
well observes, these poems are themselves far more suggestive of
the narrative elegy than of the epyllion. The books of poems
dedicated to Bittis connect Philetas directly with the Lyde of
Antimachos and. more remotely with the Nanno oi Mimnermos.
Unfortunately the sragments are too slight to warrant any very
definite conclusions. Perhaps it is safe to say, however, that
Philetas had the idyllic touch and the tendency to genre remind-
ing one os Theokritos. His language and style were probably
simple and natural. It is likely also that the poems to Bittis were
essentially lyric and subjective (cp. Hermesianax in Athenaios, 13,
598 F )·¹

Hermesianax (three books of elegies to leontion) and Phano-
kles (Ἔρωτες ἢ Καλοιῢ, younger contemporaries of Philetas, repre·
sent an archaistic type the inspiration os which appears to have
been the Hesiodic Catahgi. In Hermesianax we find the ironical
humour, in Phanokles the pursuit os poetic ω’τια, which were both
characteristic os the age. As in Antimachos and others the per-
sonal note is expressed in mythic material.

The next step, sor which Kallinos and Mimnermos had already
paved the way, was to make the myth itseli the subject, and to
reduce the personal note to a minimum. The step was taken by

1ll so, Jacoby's theory (see p. 23. n. ι) needs much revision. One could wish that
we knew more ol this collection. But at all events his thesis is neither supported
nor protecred by his assumption that the Bittis was an epikedeion or that it was
a series os poems oi the Catalogue type. Seeesp. M. Pohlenz in Χάριτες Friedrich
Leo ram Sechrrgsten Geburtstag dargebracht, Berlin¹ 1911, pp. 108-112.
