Shenstone quotes 3-4 as the text ot his song-

On every trec, in every plain,

1 trace the jovial spring in vainl ’
Α sickly languor veils mine eyes,
And fast my waning vigour ilies.

Nor flowery plain, nor budding tree,
That smile on others, smile on me;
Mine eyes irom death shall court repose,
Nor shed a tear before they close.

What bliss to me can seasons bring?

Or what the needless pride oi spring?
The cypress bough that suits the bier,
Retains its verdure all the year.

'Tis true my vine so iresh and fair
Might claim awhile my wonted cam
My rural store some pleasure yield;
So white alioci, so green a fieldl

My friends, that each in kindness vie,
Might well expect one parting sigh;
Might well demand one tender tear;
For when was Damon insincere?

But ere 1 aslr once more to view -
Yon setting sun his race renew,

lniorm me, swains; my friends, deciate,
Will pitying Delia join the prayer?

A characteristic productiori oi the man and oi bis time.
