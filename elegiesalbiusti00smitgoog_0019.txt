TIBVLLVS

primitive condition of society the expression of emotion soon
reaches the ecstatic or orgiastic stage, and that from that point,
whether the original motive was sorrow, patriotic fervour, religious
excitement‚ or love, the symptoms, whether in action or thought,
are very much the same. From this point of view therefore it
would seem most likely that, as Crusius says, the leading motives
of the elegy in its preliterary period were the lament for the
dead and the patriotic call to arms, a specific type of the hortatory
mood (προτρεπτική). ¹We find both moods united in the oldest
surviving specimen of poetry animated by the lyrico-elegiae
spirit, the dirge in Iliad 24, 7²5 f. The connection therefore
of the flute with the elegy itself would appear to suggest that this
form of poetry, though refined and raised to artistic excellence at
an early period by the Ionians, sprang originally from the orgiastic
mood. It is true that the elegy was also recited at symposia1 and -
to the accompaniment of the flute. This however involves no
contradiction. On such occasions joy and sorrow met quite as
naturally as they did in the orgiastic cults to which reference has
already been made.

On Greek soil the history of the elegy as adeveloped literary
form may be conveniently divided into two periods, the Old and
the New. The Old elegy (yth to 4th cent. ac.) comprises the
old Ionian school, the Dorian school of the Peloponnese, Solon,
Theognis, and their contemporaries, and fourth, the Attic school.
The New elegy begins with the Age of Alexander the Great and,
at least for our present purpose, extends to Parthenios, the friend
. and teacher of Cornelius Gallus, the founder of the Roman elegy.

The Ionian group (yth to 6th cent. n.c.), the earliest and greatest
period of the Old elegy, is represented, eg, by Archilochos of
Paros, Kallinos of Ephesos, Mimnermos of Kolophon.

It is interesting to observe how fully the tendencies of the
elegy yet to be are either foreshadowed or completely developed

¹Tne sympotic origin of the elegy is especially emphasized by Reitzenstein in
his Epigramm und Skolion.
