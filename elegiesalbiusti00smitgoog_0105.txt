avoid it was to avoid aconcurrence of vowels. F requency and
freedom in its use are therefore characteristic of ordinary speech,
and of comedy and satire, the literary departments most nearly
. allied to ordinary speech. Vergil avoids harsh elision, but other-
wise is noted for his freedom. With Ovid the use of elision
diminished rapidly,and the process continued until in the late
poets it practically reached the vanishing point. Tibullus was
notably careful in this important matter ; but the observations of
Hoerschelmann¹ show that there was considerable development
between books 1 anda.

Synaloepbe with est occurs in thesi at the close of the verse or
(less often) at a caesura, though at a semiternaria only in book ι’.
lt occurs in arsi only at the close of the verse. The one exception
is 1, 1, aa.

Hiatus is found only in 1, 5, 33, where see note.

Exceptions to the regular rules of prosody are rare, and more or
less characteristic of all contemporary poetry. Synaeresis occurs
but once (a, 1, 49), diaeresis, but twice (1, 7, a ; 1, 7, 40).
Shortening of e in the third person plural of the perf. indic. act.-
occasional in all dactylic verse-is to be found in a, 3, ra and
4, 5, 4. On prdcurare, r, 5, 13, choreae, 1, 3, 59, and final 6
in the present iod. act, a, 6, 41, see the notes. Wblfflin’s rule of

Ἰ sacra or sacra for Tibullus is not supported by the Ambrosianus

in 1, 3, 18 (see note). On lengthening ofa final syllable not
in hiatu, but before a caesura, see r, ro, 13, and a, a, 5 with the
notes. ’
. Closely associated with metrical technique, as already discussed,
is the length, form, and arrangement ofa sentence with relation 'to
the distich. Here however we must content ourselves with a few
general statements.

It may be said that on the whole the Greeks allowed the sentence
to run on with every variety of pause. Indeed for certain moods
the long sentence appears even to have been cultivated by some of
