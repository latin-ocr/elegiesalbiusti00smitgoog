1, 2, 14] TIBVLLVS

ἐρρέ, old amulet; ‘be it upon thine own head 1 ’ ‘omnis in vile hoc caput 1 abeat
procella,' Seneca, Thyest. 996, and often. The origin of this imprecation,

common in all languages, seems to corne from the idea of something falling or
cast down from above.

14. serta: when the lover is refused admittance, he takes the garlands
from his head and leaves them at the door where they may be seen the next
morning3 references are numerous, eg. Ovid, Amor. 1, 6, 67; Ars Amat. 2,
5283 3, 723 Rem. Amor. 323 Met. 14, 7083 Catuli. 63, 66; Propert. 1,16,
7; Anth. Pal. 5, 92; 145 ; 191;281; Ephippos, frag. 3, Kock; Antiphanes,
2,199, Kock, etc. The use of perfumes, cp. Lucret. 4, 1177, isan Easteru
custom (P. Haupt, The Song os Songs, Chicago, 1902, p. 37, n. 18).

16. fortes . . . Venus: an elegiae variation of the old alliterative
proverb, ‘fortes fortuna adiuvat,’ ‘Fortune favours the brave’ (Terence,
Phorm. 203, and often elsewhere). So Ovid, Her. 19,159,‘quod timeas
non est: auso Venus ipsa favebit '3 Ars Amat. 1, 608, ‘audentem Forsque
Venusque iuvat! Mustard cites Lugo y Davila, T eatro Popular, Novela 7
(Madrid, 1622), ‘no gusta de cobardes Venus; antes ayuda los valerosos,
como 1111116 Tibulo “Venus los fuertes ayuda.¹'' See also Mario Equicola,
Di Natura d'Amore, Venice, 1626, p. 300 b., ιΑ11111 11 fortuna gli audaci, e
Venere discaccia, e ha in odio i timidi!

17. nova: ie. ‘strange’ ‘unfamiliar’ (hence temptat), and therefore in·
volving greater risk.

18. We see 67 the houses in Pompeii that the street doors still generally
opened outward as late as the first century. The bar (111116) 67 which the
door was fastened at night could not be removed nor the door opened even
by people inside without a hey (fixo dente). This lrey was often kept 67 the
ianitor (Apuleius, Met. 9, 20, etc.) Hence salso for fixo in one late MS. of
Tibullus perhaps reflects the adultera clavis for instance of Ovid, Ars Amat.
3, 6433 iae. the girl unbolts the door with a duplicate lrey of her own.

19-20. For these accomplishments cp. 2, 1, 75-78ς 1, 8, 577 1, 9, 43;
4, 6, 11; Ovid, Amor. 1, 6, 7; 3, 1, 49-52; Anah. Pal. 5, 294, etc.
Maximianus, 3, 27,1171, ‘atque superciliis luminibusque loqui, Ι 1111010 solli·
citos, suspensos ponere gressus Ι 01 muta nullo currere nocte souo,' the only
passage that might be called an echo of Tibullus. The thought, however, is

an elegiae commonplace, and the matter is rendered still more uncertain 67 ’

160 1101 1611 the same sort of thing is found in Ovid, with whom Maximianus
was evidently very familiar. Hence, though Maximianus had doubtlessread
Tibullus, no certain evidence for it can be derived from his works. See
Introd. p. 61-2.
