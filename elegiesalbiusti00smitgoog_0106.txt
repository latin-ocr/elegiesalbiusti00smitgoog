INTRODUCTION

the Alexandrian poets. The Roman elegy on the contrary is
marked by a rapidly growing conception of the distich as a uuity.
Even in the elegies of Catullus, though sentences run through six,
eight, and ten distichs‚ we usually find at least a quasi-pause at the
close of the pentameter. In the developed elegy the long sen·
tence‚ comparatively speaking, is characteristic of Propertius.
N ext comes Tibullus, and lastly Ovid. But in all three poets there
is always a pause at the end of the pentameter, and the sentence
itself is so arranged as to bring out the symmetrical relations of

distich to distich. Cp. Tib. 1, 1, 1—4 ; 25-28 ; 45-48; a, 19- ’

2²3 59-62; 66-74,etc.; Prop.1,1,3-6;19-26;-a,1-6; 15-
22, etc.; Ovid, Amor. 1, 1, 21-24 3 2, 1-4 ; 3, 7-14‚ etc. ·
But in harmony with the simplicity of his type the sentences of
Tibullus are rarely long, and never complex. His clauses are
direct and simple; the thought is brought out more frequently by
codrdination, or even by mere juxtaposition, than by the more
common Roman habitos grouping ideas in the perspective afforded

by the various relations of hypotaxis. Hence when connecting Ἴ

particles occur they are more often codrdinate than subordinate.
Not infrequently they are omitted altogether, especially between
distichs, and the connection, as so often in English, is lett to the
reader. Here too should be rechoned the enormous use of
anaphora so characteristic of Tibullus. As Sellar (p. 245) well
says : ‘Tibullus fully recognizes the limits of the distich, and its
inadequacy to the expression of consecutive thought. Poetry
with him returns to something like its original function before it
was used as the organ of action and thought. It becomes in a
great measure again the simple expression of feeling in the form of
a prayer, a wish, or a regret.’

The sentence however is profoundly affected by the fact that.
the distich is a unit, each half of which is the complement of the
other. We must therefore so arrange what we have to say between
the two halves of the distich as to balance and unite them, and yet
to distinguish them sharply by comparison, contrast, emphasis, etc.
