many detached scenes in his love affair ὰ la mode r‘dyllique. We
have every reason therefore for considering these elegies in the
order preseribed by the poet himself.

In the first elegy it will be seen that the affair with Delia is well
on the way and that as yet the lover's sky is without a cloud.
To be sure Delia, who lives sornewhere in the city—presumably
in the Subura-is closely watched by some person not named.
This however is the usual situation of the elegiae heroine. No
antique love affair could have lasted long without the help of the
lady's house door. The excitement of evading keen·eyed duennas,
jealous ‘husbands,' and similar spoil-sports, the occasional relief
of a rough and tumble squahble with the object of one’s verses
(l. 74), or, in moments of uneontrollable exhilaration, 0f wreclring
the said house door altogether (l. 73), are details rarely absent
from the conventional programme of true love as set forth either
in elegy, epigram, comedy, or lyric.

To follow the drift of the second elegy we may imagine a
Roman supper room as the mise-enscene. Several of the poet’s
young friends are at the table drinking. The poet, who is highly
excited, calls for a stiff drink, proposes to drown his sorrows in
the traditional elegiae fashion‚ and then proceeds to unfold a piti-
ful tale to his friends.

It appears that Delia's ‘coniunx '—0ften, as here, a euphemism
for theman who at the time happens to be furnishing the mis-
tress of the elegiae lover witha house door—has gone off to the
wars in search of plunder and incidentally of fame. He has left
orders however that Delia be closely guarded during his absence,
and the poet is distressed to find that they are effectual. Thanks
to the vigilance of the custodes, the house door is incorruptible
and refuses toopen-in either direction. As the exclusus amator-
another character familiar to elegy —he naturally pauses to curse
the obstinate and unfeeling door, and in this way introduces his
individual variation of one of the most characteristic themes of

antique erotic poetry. This is the παρακλαυσίθυρον, or woeful
