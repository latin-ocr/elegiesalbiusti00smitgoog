The setting of this charming elegy is the celebration by the country folk
of some regular feast day of the Roman year. Which feast day, however, is
not beyond dispute. Preller and most modern commentatore of Tibullus
contend for the Ambarvalia (early in May), Marquardt and some more recent
authorities, for the Feriae Sementivae or Paganalia (late in January). It
seems clear that our choice lies between these 1220, but every attempt to
reacb 2 more definite conclusion is met by the facts that our knowledge of
both is incomplete, that Tibullus's description cannot be made to agree at
all points with either, and that either is in itself attended by certain difficulties
of interpretation (see the notes on 1-26).

The Ambarvalia as a sacrum privatum (which would be its character here)
occurred early in May when the crops had begun to ripen and bad weather
and blight were most likely to be fatal (18-20 n). The ceremony is mostrully
described byCatO, De Agri C ult. 141, cp. also Verg. G. 1, 338, and Servius adlo'c.

’ The most important detail is pictured in the name itself. This was the pro· y

cession of victims along the boundaries of the land to be purified followed by
the throng of worshippers crowned with olive (16 0.). The procession went
around the field three times (lustramus, 1 n). At the end of the third round
the victims were led to the altar, sacrificed, and a regular prayer offered ( 5-
24 notes). The full quota of victims consisted of a pig, sheep, and bullock
(hence ‘suovetaurilia ¹), but a single victim could be and apparently often was

substituted for three (agam, 15 n). The regular Ambarvalia for the purifi·
cation of the Roman state-which still survives in Italyas the formal ‘ Litania
Maior ’ of Rogation Week — was performed by the Fratres Arvales, and though
modified in at least one respect hythe growth of Rome from a village commu-
nity to an empire, remained to the last a magnified copy of the primitive rite.
