augeatur,' 'they took the pains to think up every possible thing that was cal·
culated to prevent their remaining without danger and to increase that dan·
ger by wearing out the soldiers,’ etc. That is, ‘their plens were so foolish that
their destruction seemed a calculation’ Nipperdey saw the point bere, but
succeediug commentators seem to have missed it altogether. Sometimes
these clauses seem to express the totally unexpected and most unwelcome, as
eg. ‘he came home to die,' where the irony ol the purpose clause is so to

speak the irony οῖ’ Fata—male: r, 10, 51 n.—carlam: the evident sphere
and significance oi cadere here are periectly familiar in popular English and
might be abundantly illustrated from our old plays, ballads, and songs. 1t is
therefore the more surprising to find thatin Latin this example is practically
unique. Plautus, Persa, 656 (Dordalus to Virgo), ‘libera eris actutum,- si
crebro cades. Ι vin mea esse ?' is an illustration rather than a parallel, and
Seneca Rhet, Controv. r, 3, 7, has been emended. cadere = peccare, ot' yielding
to any sinsul inclination, belongs to Ecclesiastical Latin, and our frequent use
ol ‘fall' in the same sense was probably derived from that sphere. -The only
non-ecclesiastical example in Latin seems to be Manil. 5, 114, ‘et minimum ,
cecidisse malum est! Our example is also included here by the Thesaurus.
But cadam h'ere does not = peccem. Sulpicia is practically literal and specific
because she is particularly drastic. This is demanded by the bitterirony, by
the fact that it carries and emphasizes the thought of the clause ot' perverse
purpose in which the temporarily despised Cerinthus is presented with a point
ol view worthy ot' him. Sulpicia is in no mood ior euphemisms (cp. 3-4),
among other things perhaps being more humiliated than she would like to
consess by an unusually vivid realization os the narrowness of her escape on
that previous occasion alluded to in 4,12(wbere see notes). This use oi
cadere—which is ‘tumble' (cp. eg. Ophelia’s song) rather than ‘sall’ss is
doubtless popular and possibly more or less characteristic ol feminine usage.

3-4. The rising' surge of wrath and scorn is marked by the sudden sbist
from bitter irony in 1-2 to the passionate assertion oi indifference 'in 3-4, as
expressed in her characteristic demand oi Cerinthus to proceed as he has
begun. So Dido says to Aeneas, A. 4, 381,‘i, sequere Italiam ventis, pete
regna per undas‚’ etc.

Note the biting contrast between the two halves os the sentence: bere, the
nrere common drudge, the lowest even in her own class ; there, ‘Sulpicia the
daughter os Servius! This is not a mere outburst of jealous fury, there is no

room bere lorjealousy. Nor is the fierce scorn ior the woman herself ; she is· ·'

not to blame. lt is sor Cerinthus that he could stoop so low, the exceeding
bitter cryofher own bumiliation. lt would be hard to find in literary artamore
scathing rebuxe, a more briefand telling expression of outraged love aad pride.
