often repeated, cp. cg. Seneca, MQ. 5, ι8, 15, ‘nihil invenies tam manifestae
utilitatis quod ιιοιι in contrarium transeat culpa! Frequently as here in con·
nection with the sword because the first sword osten introduces the topic of
war so frequently dwelt upon in discussing the history of mankind, cp. ι, 3,
37-40 ιι. For Tibullus and for the poets in general who believe (at least for
purposes of their art) in afall from grace the first sword and the first ship
mark the beginning of our long downward path since the Golden Age. A
fragment of Parthenios, ὅστις ἐπ’ ἀνθρώπουι {foces alyavayv, indicates how
faithful our poet ishere to the traditional themes of the idyllic erotic elegy, cp.
also Ovid, Met. 15, 106 f. Opponents of the fall from grace (iaesp. the
Epicureans) coutended that the sword merely marked an important
period in the long chronicle of homicide. It succeeded the club and the large
rough stone, cp. Lucret. 5, 968, ‘missilibus 'saxis et magno pondere clavae ’ς
Ηοι. Sat. 1, 3, 100,'‘mutum et turpe pecus glandem atque cubilia propter Ι
unguibus et pugnis, dein fustibus, atque ita porro Ι pugnabant armis quae
post fabricaverat usus’; Val. ilaec. 5, 145 (of the Chalybes); Plato, Rep.
358E, etc.

6. in ferasr for in=‘towards,’ i.c.⁴against,' cp. 1, 3, 523 1,8, 503 4,4,
14. For in=‘into' (of place),note esp. 1, 3, 6; 363 803 1, 5, 383 1, 9,

7-10. ln 1, r, 5 f. Tibullus described the life he desired to lead3 in 1, 2,
71 f., the life he would he happy to lead with Delia; in 1, 3, 35 f., the Golden
Age3 in 1, 5, 19 f., the life he had once hoped to lead with Delia here, the
simple life of old Rome, cp. 2, 5, 21 f.; and in ι, ιο, 39, of to-day,cp.2,1,47f.
So far as his personal experience enters into this characteristic multiplicity of ,
variations upon a single theme, the model before him, we may be sure, was
the happy days of his own childhood. For this favourite contrast of the de·
sirable past with the undesirahle present, cp. 1, 3, 35 f. with notes.

7-8. Vergil's ‘auri sacra fames quid non mortalia cogis 1 p'ectora’ (A. 3, 56)
is a theme of which the ancients never tire3 cp. Lucret. 5,1423; Seneca,
Phaedra, 5273 Rutilius, 1, 357, etc. The most of our troubles are due to it,
above all navigation (1, 3, 37-4ο n.) and war (1, 3, 47-48 n.); cp. 1, 1, r; 1,1,
493 1, r,751; 2, 3, 37; Plato, Rep. 373 D; phaedr, 66 1), Aristot. Pol.
Aah. 8, etc. We usually findit as here, cp. r,'3, 47, etc, connected with the
preachment of old-fashioned simplicity as contrasted with the present luxury,
cp. Propert. 2, ao, 25³ 3, 2, 19; 3, 5, 4; SenPhaedra, 483-564; Boeth. Com.
Phil. 2, met. 5, etc. ’

7. dirius auri: for the figure, 1, 9, 313 3, 3,11; Manilius, 5, 16; etc.
