r, 2, 55] TIBVLLVS

that of Tibullus himself in 4, 14. Bandello, Parte 2, Novella 28, ends with
practically these words.

55. nihil: for the accus. of the inner object with neuter pronouns aud
adjectives, cp. peccare, 1, 6, 16 and 71; 2, 4, 5; persuadere, 1, 9, 69; sonare,
1, 3, 603 canere, 1, 4, 73, etc. For similar usage —always characteristic of
poetry—see sonare, 2, 1, 333 iurare (of persons), 1, 4, ²43 413,15; (with
object clause of the fact sworn to) 1, 9, 31, 2, 5, ¹043 2, 6, ι3; smpirare,

⁸ 1, 6, 35 (see note); 4, 5, 11; tacere, 1, 7, 57; suadere, 2, 4, 25³ manere,

1, 6, 613 1, 8, 773 ueniere, 1, 7, 43 evigilare, 1, 8, 64; adstare, 2, 4, 573
frustrari, 2, 5, 153 vesci, 2, 5, 64; cogitare, 4, 4, 17-18, etc.

57—58. The nalve warning impresses the modern reader as a touch of
Tibullus’s sly humour and it made the same impressiou on the cultivated
reader in the Augustan Age. It derives its authority, however, from the cardi·
nal principle of magic, and therefore of antique ritual, that a charm applies
only to those who are specifically mentioned in itby name. In the antique
and primitive conception—reflected eg. in certain peculiar uses of the word
nomen (cp. 2, 5, 57 n.) -a name is areality, it has an actual connection with
the thing it designates. Agreeably therefore to the doctrine of sympathy
(see 46 n.) if we have nothing more than the name of a person, we can reach
him with a charm or conversely protect him by means of one. Under such
circumstances it follows, of course, that the charm will not work unless we
have the right name. Hence the antique practice, especially iu magle, of
addressing the deity invoked by every name known to the invoker, with the
idea, of course, that somewhere among them will be found the name of power
to which the god must respond3 cp. eg. a magic hymn to Hekate in Abel’s
Orphica, p. 2893 the cautious Roman usually added some general phrase

intended to remedy any possible deficiency in this respect, eg. in the old ,

formula of devotio (Macrob. Sat. 3, 9, 10), ‘Dis Pater Veiovis Manes, sive quo
alio nomine fas est nominate,' etc.; Servius on Verg. Α. 2, 351, ‘et pontifices
ita precabantur “Iuppiter optime maxime, sive quo alio nomine te appellari
volueris,’'’ etc. Hence conversely, and this custom is found in some savage
tribes, the reason for keeping our real name to ourselves and using an alias
for the general public. To the same point of view is due the curious old tra·
dition regarding the name of Rome; cp. eg. Macrob. Sat. 3, 9, 2, ‘constat
enim omnes urbes in alicuius dei esse tutela, moremque Romanorum arcanum
et multis ignotum fuisse ut, cum obsiderent urbem hostium eamque iarn capi
posse confiderent, certo camnine evocarent tutelares deos: quod aut aliter
urbem capi posse non crederent, aut etiam, si posset, nefas aestimarent deos
habere captivos. nam propterea ipsi Romani et deum in cuius tutela urbs
Romaest et ipsius urbis Latinum nomen ignotum esse voluerunt. . ..ipsius
