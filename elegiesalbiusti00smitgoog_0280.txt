NOTES [r, 4, 35

indeed like the seasons (cp. Hor. Od. 4, 7) they were felt as the type ol
resurrection (cp. the legenda and the ritual oi Dionysos, Adonis, etc). Tib.
passes over the point here to make it further down (35 l.) in another way.

'31·3²· Rapidity oi change has been exemplified in 29-30. The emphasis
now shills to the contrast between youth and age. llouth is strong and active,
age is wealr and impotent. The ex. ot' the racehorse is a variation eg. oi
Ennius, Amr. 374 V., 'sicut fortis equus spatio qui saepe supremo Ι vicit
Olympia, nunc senio coniectus quiescit: and esp. oi lbykos, 2, 5 Crus. (cp.
Plato, Parmen. 137 A.). The real parallel, however, is seen in passages like
. Dio Chrys. 6, 41; Plutarch, An seni, etc. 4 (785 D), which acc. to Wila·
mowitz indicate Cynlc sources. See Anrh. Pal. 9, 195 20; 21 ς Ovid, Her.
18, 166, ‘ut celer Eleo carcere missus equus,' isan echo.

25, etc. Explained by the following adjective infirmae.

32. prior: cp. 1, 2, 69n. Latin osten, and Greek still oltener, esp. in
poetry, uses an adjective in the predicate where we prefer an adverb or an ad·
verbial expression. This process, esp. with adjectives denoting a ternporary
condition, eg. ol inclination, knowledge, and their opposites, ol time and
season, order and position (Gild.-Iodge, 325, R. 6), begins with Plautus and
grows steadily. For prior here, cp. Ovid‚ Ars Amat. 2, 218, ‘qui meruit
· caelum, quod prior ipse tulit’; Propert. 4, 5, 42, ‘nempe tulit fastus, ausa
rogare prior’; Xen. Vect. 4, 12, δοκεῖ δέ μοι καὶ ἡ πόλις προτέρα ἐμοῦ
ταῦτα ἐγνωκέναι. Another case is stultos in 34 below-carcere: ‘the
barriers.’ ln this use generally plural. The singular, as here (ie. :bar-
riers’)‚ is ior the most part poetic. Ovid, Trist. 5, 12, 26, uses the plural but
once, otherwise always in the singular.
