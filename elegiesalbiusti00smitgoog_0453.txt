11-16. Apollo was first addressed ns the god of song. He is now addressed
as the god of prophecy (cp. 2, 3, 21-223 Ovid, Mei. ι, 517; Stat. T beb. 1, 706;
Aisch. Eumen. 19, etc.) in general (11). The poet then mentions the four

ἢ kinds of divination used and recognized by the Romans. These are augury

(rr-12), sortes (13), aruspicina (13-14), and the Libri Sibyllini (15-16).
The first three are also mentioned in 1, 8, 3-'4, where see note. Here, of
course, only the fourth, the one with which Messalinus is concerned, is of im-
portauce. By placing it last a natural and easy transition is found for the
topics upon which the poet wishes to enlarge.

11-12. Τὴε college of Augure, raised to fifteen by Sulla and to sixteen by
Caesar (as in the case of the X Vviri mentioned above), continued until well

into the fourth century nn. The disciplina which has been derived from·

Lutiurn and Central Italy instead of Etruria is traditionally associated through
the well-known episode iu the story of Romulus and Remus with the very
beginnings of Rome itself. The augurs were the official representatives of
the science of auspicia, a method of divination peculiar to the Romans, the
object of which, ns with the Libri Sibyllini, was not to discover the secrets
of the future but to gain the sanction of the gods for the given matter in hand
For all the meticulous details of procedure the student is referred to any good
classical dictionary nv. Augur. The ‘auspicia ex avibus' to which Tibullus
here refers had practically ceased to be considered as early as Cicero's time.
Originally, however, as the word auspicium iteelf implius, they were the only
ones with which the augurs concerned themselves at all.

η. fati: for the gen. with providus cp. r, 8, 3 n.; Ovid, Met. 12, 18, ‘at
veri providus augur,’ etc. F irst in Cicero. The use of adjectives with a geni·
tive of reference, limited in early times, was considerably extended in the
classical period. The construction is characteristic of poetry and was there·
fore common in the rhetorical poetiziug prose of later times.

13. sortes: 1, 3, 'rr-12 n.—aruspex . . . exte: 2, r, 25 n.

¹4· lubrica: probably literal, referring to the smooth, slippery exta (Post-
gate).—notis: so Ovid, Met. 7, 6003 Lucan, 1, ⁶¹93 Seneca, Oed. 352 and
often. ΤΙιο Greek equivalent of this technicnl term is σημεῖον, see λοβόςΙ in
Suidas and Hesychios.

15. sibylla:'there were a number of Sibyls,and the extremely difficult ¹

question of their identity and of their relations to each other had been

thoroughly discussed by Varro a few years before these lines were written
(see esp. Lactant 1, 6, 10). They are all associated, however, with the
worship of Apollo; the institution, so to spealr, spread with the cult, and an

examination of their geographical distribution carries us back to Asia Minor
in the vieinity of the Troad. The multiplicatiori of Sibyls is the multiplica·
