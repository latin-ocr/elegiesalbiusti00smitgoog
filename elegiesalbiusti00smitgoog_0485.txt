in Greek and usually in the sarne connection, Theokrit. 10, 2ο, μὴ δὴ μέγα μνθεῦ· ³

Soph. Elekl. 830, μηδὲν μέγ’ ἀΰσῃς, etc, and this is osten the moral os
the tragedy itself3 cp. Soph. Antig. 1350; Aisch. Prom. 362 l.; etc.

Note that the idea os ‘magna loquor’ is given all possible emphasis in this ¹

line. The humorous exaggeration brings out the more sharply the con-
trasted ‘and yet such a little thing as the “clausae fores,'’' etc. For the

same device cp. eg. Ter. Eun. 64:

et quod nunc tute tecum iratus cogitas, .
‘egon illam, quae illum, quae me, quae non . . . sine modo,
mori me malim: sentiet qui vir siem ⁸:
, haec verba ea una mehercle falsa lacrimula
quam oculos terendo misere vix vi expresserit,
restinguet, et te ultro accusabit, et dabis
ultro ei supplicium.

ι See also Ovid, Amor. 2, 1, 15.

ra. excutiunt: ‘shake out! The metaphor is taken from shaking clothes
rn order to get out anything that may be concealed in them, Greek, ἐκσείειν.
Α favourite word with Seneca and Persius (1, 49, Gildersleeve); cp. Seneca,
Τνοαιί.Ι 575, ‘magnifica verba mors prope admota excutit' upon which his own
words, Epist. 82, 7, are a comment, ‘magna verba excidunt cum tortor popos-
cit manum, cum mors propius accessit ’3 cp. also Cicero, Sall. 24, ‘excutient
tibi istam verborum iactationem’; Domo, 765 Phil. 2, 73; etc. Aisch.
Prom. 360, is a slightly different figure. Propertius, 1, 5, 15, says in this con-
nection, ‘quotiens ad limina curres, Ι cum tibi singultu sortia verba cadent?

1344. Cp. t, 5, ι-2; Propert. 2, 25, 2ο, ‘ultro contemptus rogat et peccasse

fatetur Ι laesus, et invitis ipse redit pedibus'; Hor. Epod. 11, 20, ‘iussus abire =

domum ferebar incerto pede'; Ovid, Rem. Amor. 216; 7853 etc.

¹3· rediturum: for omission os the subject accusative, ι, 5, 73 n; r,3,
27 n. Extremely common in the comedy, found everywhere in the historians
and ordinary enough in epistolary style. Frequency ol it in the poets, esp. of
the Augustan Age, is due to the influence ot' the older writers or to metrical
convenience. Most uncommon, because the omitted subiect is not to bere·
ferred to the subject ol the governing verb, are 1, 3, 273 2, 6, 483 4, 8, 8.
This is the only ex. in Tibullus of the future infin. so used.

14. ipse: ‘ol its own accord,’ cp. 1, 3, 45 n.; Propert. 2, 25, 2ο.

15-16. Cp. 2, 5,1o5-106; 2, 1, 81-82. Α variation isthe actual threat to
disarm Cupid or to disable him in some other way. This motive has been
popular in modern art and literature since the Renaissance, and it is so sug·
gestive os Alexandrian poetry‚ especially of bucolic and epigram, that one
would expect to find it equally popular in the later literature ot' Antiquity. I
