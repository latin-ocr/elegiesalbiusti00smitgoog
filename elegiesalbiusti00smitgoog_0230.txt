NOTES [1, 2, 72

605 serus, 1, 7, 62; 1, 9,4; sedulus, 1, 5, 3321111 723 2, 4, 423 demens, 1, 9,
783 perfidus, 1, 8, 633 invitus, 1, 8, 8, etc-contextus: the transfer from
the garments to the weater is not infrequent in poetry, cp. Ovid, Her. 12, 152,
‘adiunctos aureus urguet equos,’ etc. Sostava Ceres, 1, 1, 15, and often.

7⁰· Martial, 9, 49, 4, ‘in hac ibam conspiciendus equesss is quoted as an
echo; but cp. Ovid, Trist. 2, 114, ‘conspiciendus munst-conspiciendus:
‘the observed of all observers,’ a poetic word, cp. 2, 3, 52. The gerundive
as a predicate adjective with intransitive verbs is also found in·1‚ 2, 763 2, 3,
52³ 4, 6, 4; asa factitive predicate, 1, 6, 37; 1, 7, 403 4, 3, 223 aa carrying
a brief appositional clause or merely as an attribute 011211, eg. 1, 5, 14; 1, 6,
223 1, 7, 563 etc. On the dative with fatalis, 2, 5, 5711. Gerundive forms
generally stand aa here in the second half of the pentameter just before the
final dissyllable (of the 21 exx. in Tib. 16 212 01 this sort and the same
predilection is seen 111 Ovid).

71-78. Poverty with happiness (71-74) is set ovet against wealth with mis-
ery. A favourite theme in antiquity. Most frequently the moral is enforcerl by
comparing the past with the present, cp. 1, 3, 35-4811. Propertius, 1, 14, 15 1.,
however, deserves special consideration in connection with Tib. here, ‘nam
quis divitiis adverso gaudet Amore? Ι nulla mihi tristi praemia sint Venere! Ι
illa potest magnas heroum infringere vires, Ι illa etiam duris mentibus esse
dolor: Ι 1112 neque Arabium metuit transcendere limen, Ι 1122 timet ostrino,
Tulle, subire toro, Ι 21 miserum toto iuvenem versare cubili: Ι quid relevant
variis serica textilibus? Ι quae mihi dum placata aderit, 11011 ulla verebor Ι regna
vel Alcinoi munera despicere! For the same contrast treated from the point ’
of view of the philosophas, see esp. Seneca, Epist. 90, 41 ff.

7¹· ipse: see 1, 1, 7 n.-ai: 60 cases of a monosyllable before the
masc. caesura are found in Tibullus, 20 of themate est in synaloephe, see 1,
4, 77 n., 4 are elided with the preceding word (haec, 1, 2, 59: e, 1, 9, ⁶93 et,
2, 4, 21 ; 4, 6, 19), 10 212 parts of esse (5 of which are preceded by another
monosyllable), and of the 26 remaining all -but 5 (si, 1, 2, 71 ; quas, 1, 6,
55; mors, 2, 4, 43 ; ard 4, 3, 173 lux, 4, 12, 1) are preceded by another
monosyllable. 111 other words, in Tibullian usage, apart from estin syna·
loephe which comes under another head, two monosyllables instead of one
before 2 masculine caesura ate preferred in the hexameter (75⁰4) and are
invariable in the pentameter.

72. iungere et: et elides and acts as a final consonant between iungere
and in. This is most frequent in Propertius, but itis never common and
with an infinitive as here is very rare ; only Lygdamus, 3, 2, 4 ; Propert. 1, 5,
203 1, 17, 183 2, 8, 32 3 2, 29, 243 Ovid, Anror. 1,9,22; Ars Amat. 3,
