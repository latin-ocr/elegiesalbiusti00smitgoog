‘Can't you be content with 1111111111,Ν11111111Ρ-Α111, women prefer

⁸ wealthy lovers, 1 see that-So be it, then. She shall blaze with J'ewels at

my expense; she shall be brave in Coan silk and Tyrian purple wruag from my
estate.

‘Every one knows ’tis all they care 111. Otherwise she would not be at the
beck and call 11 that foreign boor who time and again has been knocked
down to the highest bidder-and proved a poor investment.

‘Yon take Nemesis away from the city. May your crops never grow and
your wine neverbe fit to drink! 11 the girls will only keep away from the

Ι country, the 11111111 the field are welcome to go and we will 111111 to acorns

and spring water, the diet 11 primitive man. Α meagre diet, perhaps, but
they loved where they pleased, and without hindrance. Their garments were
plain; but 11 my love is to be thwarted, fine clothes are a poor consolation.
Away then to the country, and to the 1111 11 1 slave, since my mistress has
willed it so.’

uncommon in literary Latin, where it is most frequently found in interjections
as here. lt is therefore much more emphatic even than in English. Hence,
the very exaggeration here may lead us to suspect that the poet is not so serious
aster all as he would have us believe. For the well-worn theme 11 the lover
11 a slave, see 1, 5, 5, with notes and references.
