NOTES [r, 1, 54

53. te: as opposed to me ln 55. Both are emphatic, cp. note on me in 5.
- Messalla: see Introd. p. 34.

54. exuvias: trophies and memorials of this sort were regularly placed in
the vestibulum, which was often very large. The custom is frequently referred
to; eg. Cicero, Phil. 2, 68; Verg. A. 2, 5043 Propert. 3, 9, 26; Ovid, Trist.
3‚1,33; Sueton. Nero, 383 Sil. Ital. 6, 4343 Juv. 7,125. All such-things
could be lrept in the family only so long as it retained possession of the house
in which they had been set up, Pliny, H. N. 3, 7.

'lhis first complimentary reference to his friend and patron is particularly
tactful, not only because M. was himself distinguished and had a long line of
distinguished ancestors, but also because he is known to have been unusually
proud of his pedigree, and especially interested in such matters. Pliny says,
I.c., ‘exstat Messallae oratoris indignatio quae prohibuit inseri genti suae
Laeuinorum alienam imaginem? etc.

Observe the three successive pentameters ending in pluvias, vias, exuvias.
Τὴε homoeoteleuton, however, is not sufficiently complete here to deserve the
modern name of rhyme. So far as the Roman elegiae distich of the classical
period is concerned examples of what we should term ‘thyming' pentameters
are very rare, cp. Catullus, 83, 3-

mule, nihil sentis: si nostri oblita taceret,
sana esset: nunc quod gannit et obloquitur,

non solum meminit, sed, quae multo acrior est res,
irata est: hoc est, uritur et loquitur,

and the famous pentameters attributed to Vergil (Donatus, Vita Vergilii, 70) -

sic vos non vobis vellera fertis oves.
sic vos non vobis fertis aratra boves.
sic vos non vobis mellificatis opes.
sic vos non vobis nidificatis aves,

with each of which the introductory hexameter, ‘hos ego versiculos feci: tulit
alter honorem,’ was to be repeated. Terminal rhymes, though always rare in
the classical poets, are most frequent in the hexameter. The most strik-
ing cases are Cicero, De Consulatu, 50 (see Div.1,11,2) and Modestinus
(3d cent. aaa), Anti. Lot. 273, 5-11, Riese. Elsewhere, this type is for the
most part confined to‘couplets,'eg.Lucret.1,265; 1,664; 1,734; 1,961;
ι. 108& 2, 417³ 2, 581; a 626; 5, 370; s, 960; ⁶. 9983 verg. E· 4, sor
