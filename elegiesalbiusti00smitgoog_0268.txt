Priapos is an ancient divinity, hut his first important appearance asa god .

in anything like an aristocratic milieu was when he tigured iu the famous
processioa of Ptolemy described by Athenaios, 5, aot C-D. This was in the
Alexandrian Age. His appearance in literature also dates from the Alex·
andrian Age and is especially characteristic of that period. Titles like the
Πρίαπος ol Xenarchos, the Πρίηπος os Sotades, and the Πριάπεια of Euphorios-
cp. also Theokrit. 1, 81 (with Schol.) and numerous references and traditional
matter in later authorities-suggest how large the literature associated with
the name of Priapos must once bave been. The remains os it now surviving
are confined to a number oi epigrama in the Anthology (mostly in bks 6, ιο,
and 16). The marked revival of interest in Priapos as a literary theme in
the Augustan Age is still attested not only by this poem, but by its companiou

¹ piece, Hor. Sat. 1, 8, and above all, by the collection known as the Pra'apea:
cp. also, such passages as Ovid, Fasti, 1, 391 ; 6, 3193 Met. 9, 3473 Trist.
r, ro, 263 Verg. 6.4, 110 ς E. 7, 33, andhenceforth to the end os the literature,
eg. Calpum. a, 953 Nemes. 2, 51; Mart. 6, 163 495 7²³ 733 8, 403
etc.

The serious worship os Priapos persisted tor ages in spite oi continued and
virulent attacks upon it by the Church Fathers, cp. Arnob. 6, 25 ς Lactant.
Dio. 1,21; Augustin. C. D, 6, 7; Prudent. Contra Symmach. 1, 1023 etc.

An appropriate title sor this piece would be ‘Priapus de Arte rimandi!
The rest is merely framework. The ironical humour os the idea¹ and oi its
presentation isworthy of Ovid in his most mischievous mood. ltisin fact
an important representative ol that type of mock didactic literary art which
culminated a lew years later in the Ars Amatoria of Ovid himself. For
another interesting example see N onnos, Dionysioka, 42, 209.

The appearance here ol Priapos as a ‘magister amoris' is unique so lar as
the surviving literature is concemed, but the constant associatiou of him with
Pan, who is traditionally a ‘magister amoris’ (cp. esp. Nonnos, ιω Apul.
Met. 5, 253 Longus, 2, 7), as well as the tone ol the piece itself suggest that
Priapos in this rdle is like Pan in the saum thle, a well-nom tradition ol the
Hellenistic poets, and to be derived either from the bucolic or from some
department os literary art not sar removed from it. It is worth noting, lor
example, that the most considerable influeuce ot our piece upon later Roman
poetry isto be seen in Nemesianus, 4, 55 ff. i.e. in the bucolic.

Another type of Ars Amandi are the instructions ot¹ the lena to her charge,
a stock theme οἱ the New comedy, then in the Roman elegy (Ovid, Amor.
1, 83 Propert. 4, 5) and finally reappearing long afterward in a series of
dreary compositions os the tilteenth and sixteenth centuries.

The sly emphasis upon the pathetic and even upon the heroic in language
