As a source however for biographical data of this sort the Ι
works of any poet are rendered peculiarly uutmstworthy by the
fact that he is not necessarily a historian.

‘Od's life! must one swear to the truth of a song,'

as Prior once said to his Chloe, and this protest applies with
especial force to the particular 'department of amatory poetry
in which Tibullus won his reputation. The Roman elegiae poet
is bound to be most horribly in love. This is de rigueur.

Usually the object of his affections is either a freedwoman or '

a woman whose soeial or legal status places her in that class.
This rule is an old convention of erotic poetry and is in harmony
with the actual conditions of antique lif .

When the elegies inspired by the joys and sorrows of his love
have reached a sufficient number the poet mingles with them for
the sake of variety such elegies on other subjects as he may care
to preserve, conceals the identity of his mistress under a pseudo

. nym, and publishes his book. Ostensibly founded upon his own

affair, the elegies tobis mistress are in form biographical. The
poet however is of course free to iuterweave fact with fiction,
actual events with mere literary motives3 and only those who are
in the secret can be sure which is which. The rest of the world
must be content to guess. As guessers however we must remem-
ber that the simple saith of the old commentators wh0, like Prior's
Chloe, took every reference at its face value, is not more unreason-
able than the sweeping incredulity of some of our modern critica

As we shall see, Tibullus is peculiarly difficult to deal with from
this point of view. The first book was probably published soon
after Messalla's triumph in the fall of 27 nc. The ten elegies it
contains were written at different times in the previous four or
live years. The order of their composition cannot be determined.
Τὴε order of their arrangement, however, doubtless goes back to
the author himself, and, as in the caseos other antique collections,
was dictated by a desire for variety.
