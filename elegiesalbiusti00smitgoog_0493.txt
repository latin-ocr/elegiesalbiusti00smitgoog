4, 2, 1] TIBVLLVS

was the presente from husbands, lovers, and other available males. These
presente were always expected, cp. Lygd. 3,1 (a poem on a similar occa-
sion) ; Plaut. Miles Glor. 691, Mart. 5, 84, 11 ; Sueton. Vesp. 19 3 Digest, 24,
1, 31, 83 etc.

‘Sulpicia has arrayed herself, Mars, for your kaleuds. You will do well
to come down and look at her—Venus won’t mind. Take heed, though, ·
lest you find yourself disermed. When Love desires to iuflame, he lights his
two torches at her eyes. Beauty is her haudmaid and never leaves her side.
She is like Vertumnus, everything becomes her. Sing her praises, Apollo
audye Pierian maids. May she see many returns of this festal day. No girl
is more worthy of your tuneful company)

See especially, the elegy of Luigi Alamanni,'Flora ips Campagna.

1-2. Note the graceful compliment to Sulpicia gained hya skilful varia·
tion of the thought. The regular habit of dressing up on feast days is pre·
sented to Mars as a personal matter (tibi culta). Then the conventional
invitation to the divine recipient of the courtesy to be present (2, 5, 5, etc.)
is coupled with the suggestion that it will be worth his while, cp. 4, 4, 3-4.

1. Sulpicia: lntrod. p. 77.

2. spectatum: the only ex. of the supine in Books 1, 2, and 4.-ei sapis:
conversational. ,
3. hoc Venus ignoscit: Propert. 2, 28, 33 (asking Jupiter to take pity on

Cynthia who is ill), ‘hoc tibi vel poterit coniunx ignoscere Iuno: Ι frangitur
’ et Iuno siqua puella perit.’ For the prosody,1,10,13n.-violente: this
epithet of Marsis found elsewhere only in Seneca, Troad. 185.

4. That is, Mars is in danger of falling in love with his worshipper. For this
conventionel symptom of the process cp. Propert. 4, 4, 21 (Tarpeia at the
first sight of Tatius), ‘obstupuit regis fecie et regalibus armis Ι interque
oblitas excidit urna manus’; Ovid, Her. 16, 253, ‘dum stupco visis (nam
pocula forte tenebam), Ι tortilis a digitis excidit ensa meis’; Met. 14, 349,
‘quae simul ac iuvenem virgultis abdita vidit, Ι obstipuit. cecidere manu
quas legerat herbas: Ι flammaque per totas visa est errare medullas ’3 etc.

5-6. ‘Eyes of fire’ are not uncommou, cp. Anakreont. 15, 18 Crus. (direc-
tions 'to the painter), τὸ δὲ βλέμμα νῦν ἀληθῶς Ι ἀπὸ τοῦ πυρὸς ποίησον·
Propert. 2, 3, 14, ‘non oculi, geminae sidera nostra faces’; Ovid, Met. 1,
498, ‘videt igne micantes Ι sideribus similes oculos!

Doubtless the pretty variation given here was conventional enough, but I
have not yet found it elsewhere in antiquity. It appeared early in English
(doubtless as an echo of our poet) and seems always to have been more or
less popular, cp. ‘Rosalynde's Description' in Thomas Lodge’s Rosalynde
(publishedin159o),L01id0n, 1902, p. 82-

488
