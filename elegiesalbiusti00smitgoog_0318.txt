noras [1. ⁶, 29

The same story is related of Erymanthos and Aphrodite in Ptol. Chennos, 1;
cp. the curse in Plaut. Asin. 770, ‘si quem alium aspexit, caeca continuo siet,'
and-the idea in all these prototypon of ⁴ Peeping Tom’ still lingers in more

than one popular story and phrase—sit timuisse: the perfect has its full ι

force. A subject infin. with esse unaccompanied by a substantival or adver-
bial predicate (cp. 3 n.) as here is rare. The only remaining ex. in Tib. is
4, 31 3·

25-26. This motive (which still flourishes, no doubt, though yielding to
the superior advantages of palmistry) is not found elsewhere in 'the elegy.
For the comedy, however, cp. Naevius, frag. 78 R. (speaking of a flirt), ‘anulum
dat alii spectandum, a labris aliurn invocat,’ etc.; Plaut. Asin. 778, ‘spectan-
dum ne quoii anulum det neque roget.¹ ’

25. gemmas signumque is indefinite. but thejewels or the workmanship
in rings or bracelets is clearly meant—elus: this form of is is very rare in
dactylis verse: Propert. 4, 2, 35; 4, 6, 67.

26. por causam: ‘by means of an excuse,’ ‘under a pretext.’ per
causam = ‘under the pretext of‚’ occurs first in Cicero, Dom. 10 and 13, then
inCaes. B. G. 7, 9, 1; B. C. 3, 24‚s; 3, 76, 15 Bell. Alex. 49, 1; Bell. Asa
32, 23 73, 3; Livy, 2, 32, r; 22, 61, 8, Sueton. ch, 1; Otho, 33 all these
with a limiting genitive. With the pronominal equivalent of agenitive we
have Livy, Ῐ, 49, 53 44, 44, 83 Seneca, Bm· 4, 35, 23 suem· M· ²· 1¹¹
poetry we have only this and two cxx. in Ovid‚ the one a partial quotation,
the other an evident reminiscence, of the passage before us, cp. Trist. 2, 452
(quoted in 8 n.), and Her. 20, 139, ‘dumque suo temptat salientem pollice
venam, Ι candida per causam bracchia saepe tenet.’ The prose cons. would
have been ‘memini me tetigisse manum per eausam probandi,’ ‘bracchia
tenet per causam temptandi’ But percussam here is an adverbial phrase
(a translation of διὰ πρόφασιν, or suggested by iti) suggested by the preced-
ing clause but limiting tetigisse (tenet in the Ovidian em).

27-28. For the scene suggested cp. Ovid‚ Amor. 1, 4, 51, ‘vir bibat, usque
roga (precibus tamen oscula desintl) Ι dumque bibit, furtim, si potes, adde
merum! Ι sibene compositus somno vinoque iacebit, Ι consilium nobis resque
locusque dabunt’; 2, 5, 13; Jnv. r, 575' Hor. Od. 3, 6, 25, etc.

28. sobria pocula: more common is the transferred epithet sobria with
aqua, cp. 2, 1, 46, Propert. 3,17‚ 11 (⁴sobria nox'); Stat. Silv. 4, 2, 37
(‘ sobria rura'), etc. The pattern of it, νήφοντος θεοῦ = ‘water,' in Plato,

Leg. 773 D, was much criticized and discussed by the later rhetoricians, cp.
Plutarch, De Audiendr's Poetis, 1 (Mor. 15 Ε, cp. 791 B), and esp. Longin.
De Sublim. 32, 7.
