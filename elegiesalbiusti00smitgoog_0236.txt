Above all the bitter dregs of the cup are reserved by the angry gods for the
scoffer and the proud (1, 8, 7¹3 Propert. r, 9 and 1, 73 Anth. Pal. 12. 23,
etc.). Youth is the time for love—and youth is fleeting (1, 1, 69-74 and
notes). Conversely, ‘turpe senilis amor’; γέρων ἐραστὴς ἐσχάτη κακὴ τυχή·
