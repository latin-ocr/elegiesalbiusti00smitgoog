κοιμήσας δ’ ὅγε φῦλα πανημερέων ἀνθρώπων
καὶ ζαμενεῖς ἀνέμων πνοιὰς καὶ κύματα πόντου
πηγάς τ’ ἀενάων ὑδάτων ποταμῶν τε ῥέεθρα
θῆράς τ’ ὀἰωνούς τε τά τε ζώει τε rai ἔρτει
cingor, ἤρειψεν ὑπὸ χρυσέαις πτερύγεσσιν.

89. furvis alia: cp. ag. the nigras alas of Sleep in Claudian, In Rufi 2,
325, and the epithet κυανόπτερος in Nonnos, 31, 175.

90. Dreams, too, are the children os Night (Hes. Theog. 212; Eurip. Hek.
703 Ovid, Fasti, 4, 662;.etc.). They also accompany Sleep as here in ag.
Ovid, Met. 11, 613, and Stat. Theb. ro, 112, two famous passages osten imi·
tated in mediaeval and modern poetry. Cp. also Lukian’s ‘Isle os Dreams'

(Vera Hist. 2, 32) in which Sleep is king. But apparently nowhere else do
Sleep and Dreams follow the chariot os Night. The picture with which

Tibullus closes this elegy is, so far as Ι know, unique in classical literature. -
incerto pede: the phrase is⁸ apparently meant to convey the unsubstantial
quality, the confused and conlusing unreality os dreams. Lukian, l.c., says
os the ‘Isle os Dreams,' εἷχε δέ κσὶισύτή τι τοΐς ὀνείροις ποριιπλήσιον· intexui-¹
ρει γὰρ προσιόντων ἡμῶν καὶ ὑπέφευγε καὶ πορρωτέρω ὑπέβαινε.

‘lhis piece was occasioned by a birthday of the poet's young married friend
Cornutus. Is he to be identified with the Cerinthus oi 4, 2-12? 11 so,this
would probably be the ideal epilogue os an unusually interesting love attair,
see Introd. p. 86.

Tibullus assumes the character of the officiating priest at the regular sacri-
fiee to the Genius on this occasion and pretends to interpret his will.

‘Letusutter words ol good omen. The Genius comes to his altar. Let
all be silent until he has received his lull meed of sacrifice and praise.

‘May he grant you whatsoever you ask, Cornutus-There, why do you¹

hangbaclr? He says he will. Askhimt' ’ ’

’ ‘I prophesy that you are going to ask that your wise’s love may always be
yours. By this time, methinks, the gods themselves have learned that request
of yours by heart. Aye, rather her love than all the wealth oi Ormus and of
Indi

‘Your wish is granted. May you both be lovers still when both oi you are
old and grey, and may the omen thou hast given, Natalis, prove true and ere
long bring little t‘olk to play about thy ieet)

1. bona verba: ie. ‘of good omen! So osten in ceremonial usage, cp.
eg. Ovid, Fasti, 1, 72, ‘prospera lux oritur. linguis animisque favete! Ι nunc
