ις. laus . . .'trlbttstur . . . restituisse: instead of quod restitueris is due
to the analogy of verbs of emotion, with which the infinitive was the original
and in some cases always the favourite construction, cp. Verg. A. 2, 585, ‘ex-
stinxisse nefas tamen et sumpsisse merentis l laudabor poenas'3 Pers. 1, 86,
‘doctas posuisse figuras Ι laudatur'; Propert. r, 7, 11, ‘me laudent dorne
solarn placuisse puellae'3 etc.

26. optabunt quisque : the only other exx. of the cons. adsensum in the
Tibullian corpus are certainly non-Tibullian, viz. Lygd. 3, 4, ιο, Pan.
Messal. 4, 1, 187. quisque never takes a plural verb iu Propertius or Horace
aud acc. to Burman's Index the only exception in Ovidis Ars Amat. 1, 109, ‘ re·
spiciunt oculisque notant sibi quisque puellam! Such cxx. as Amor. 3, 2, 18,
‘vincamus dominae quisque favore suac' are not parallels. So iu Vergil the
'one good ex. seems to be A. 11, 185. The cous. ad sensum (never common
with quisque, nemo, etc.) is most frequent in aute· aud post-classical
writers and iu Livy.

This poem like 4, 3 is written in the person of Sulpicia. The occasion is

her lover's birthday. The piece was perhaps suggested by 4, 8, verses by
Sulpicia herself referring possibly to the same occasion (see however notes ad

loa). Elegies 5 and 6 are complementary and should be compared through·
out.

‘This day shall ever be the day of days for me, Cerinthus, for it gave me
you. The Futes decreed at your birth that you should sway the hearts of
womankind. More than all others I burn sor you—but 1 care not. Nay, 1
welcome the smart if only your flame answers mine. Oh Genius, I beseech
thee, make him love me as I love him! Only let him thrill whenever he
thinks of me, aud 1 will make thee vows and offerings without stint. But if
he is now sighing for another love, disown the traitor and desert him! And
do thou, Venus, be just: either make him mineus I am his or else set me
free. Nay rather biud ns with an adamantine chain that shall outlast time.

‘ His desires chime with mine but he is less outspoken, be is too shy to say
the words of his prayer aloud. But thou, Natalis, art a god and knowest all
our thoughts, therefore grant his petition. What matter whether he speak it
aloud or no?’
