pluris amor,’ and in Ovid, Ars Amat. 1, 42, ‘dum licet et loris passim potes ire
solutis, Ι elige cui dicas “tu mihi sola places.” Ι haec tibi non tenues veniet
delapsa per auras: Ι quaerenda est oculis apta puella tuis' (cp. the echo¹ of
Ovid in Petrarch, Son. 172, ‘A cu' io dissi “Tu sola mi piaci.’' ’). ‘Formula
est quae proverbii speciem referat,’ said Broukhusius, ad loc. over two cen·
turies ago, and the same is urged now by some of Professor Postgate’s critics
and with a great appearance of probability. If so, no significance can be
attached to its reappearance. Moreover when Professor Postgate says that
‘these words are found first in Propertius’ he begs his own question. The
priority of Propertius to this poem is yet to be proved. More important,
however, is his contentiori (Introd. to his edit. p. xlviii) that Ovid’s distich
is a combination of this expression with 13 below (but see n. ad loa). Ovid’s
‘borrowing here,’ he says, ⁴ is obvious,' and he finds in the fact a proof that
this last book was published before the date of the Ars Amatoria, ae. before
rae. 2, hence that it was Ovid who imitated Lygdamus, not Lygdamus who
imitated Ovid (Introd. p. 74). Even if we grant, however, for the sake of
argument that Ovid had this passage before him, it by no means follows that
he saw it in the published miscellany now before us, it does not follow that
the piece had ever been published at all at that time. Ovid himself had been
amember of Messalla's circle (Introd. p. 37) and could have easily seen the

verses there. As long, however, as Professor Postgate clings to his theory that Ι
our poem is a mere forgery in the name of Tibullus written after the appear·

ance of Propertius he must establish a terminus post quem for its composition

or lind himself quite unable to answer the uncomfortable question, ‘which Ι

was Ovid, the imitator or the imitatedi’ The question is then exactly the

same as that which confronted us in the case of Ovid and Lygdamus and we Ι

are no nearer a solution than before. The presence of ‘tu mihi sola places’
here, in Propertius, and in Ouid, may possibly be due to an association of
some sort, but it can hardly be said to have any bearing on the authen·
ticity of this poem—praeter: only here in the Tibullian corpus, never in
Propertius.

4. Professor Postgate thinks this line isan imitation of Propert. 4, 4, 32,
‘et formosa oculis arma Sabina meis’ (again assuming that his thesis of
Propertian priority is proved). Surely a phrase as simple if not as common·
place as this is incapable of being bormwed, cp. Catullus, 86, 1, 'Quintia for·
mosa est multis! Moreover, the reading fhrmosa in Propertius is anything
but certain (famosa, NFL, Phillimore, Rothstein, etc).
