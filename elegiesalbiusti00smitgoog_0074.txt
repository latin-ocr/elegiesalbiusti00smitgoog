own individual genius, he also had a definite ideal in view. At
all events it is significant to observe that, taken point by point, i

Tibullus reflects faithfully, sofar as we know it, the idyllic-erotic 3

elegy, the standard type of Mimnermos as modified by Philetas. ·

The ideal os Tibullus, the ideal os the traditional type of which y

he is himself the only representative now surviving, is the art that
conceals art. The value and rarity of this style are not always
sully appreciated even by those who admire it most. Itis pe·
culiarly liable to misinterpretation because, though rull os reserves,
it betrays no indications os the lact. The reserves of literary art,
the things a poet ignores, not because he cannot say them, but be·
cause he does not choose to say them, are the last to be detected.
In our estimate of Tibullus it is well to keep this in mind. In
dealing with any poet, above all with a poet of the Tibullian type,
we are somewhat in danger of mistaking choice sor necessity, pe-
culiarities and limitations of department for peculiarities and limi-
tations ol individual genius.

For example it is frequently stated that the education os
Tibullus was probably nothing more than that, let us say, of an
average country gentleman in the time of Augustus. The state-
ment can only be derived from the ’ῖαεῖ that he makes no
great show os learning. If so, it rests on the naive assumption
that a poet never sails to tell us all he knows. As a matter os fact
any display os learning would be quite out of place in the idyllic
elegy, above all, as Marx has observed, in poems ostensibly ad-
dressed to women of the people like Delia and Nemesis.¹ T hat
here as elsewhere Tibullus is a conscious artist is proved, if prool
is needed, by the fact that in poenis os a non-idyllic character
(like 1, 7 and 2, 5), evidences of special learning are by no means
absent.

So of the fact that he says nothing of the many great contem-

1This point is in no way disturbed by Jacoby's adverse criticism, Rhein. Mus.
65, 68, n. 2. The matter is a question oi dramatic propriety. From this point
of view whether the poem was actually written lor Delia or not makes no difler-
ence. lt is enough that it is addressed to her.
