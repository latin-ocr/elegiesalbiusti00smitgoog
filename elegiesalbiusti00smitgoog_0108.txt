first line at the beginning of the second, and are therefore quite
different from the characteristic form of Propertius, 1, 1, 1-2.

So if the distich is filled by a succession of sentences or clauses
it is usual to clamp the two halves by avoidinga too frequent pause
at the close of the hexameter. Tibullus often pauses near the
beginning of the pentameter, as in r, 1, 34 and 4o; 2, 4 ; ²83
343 583 88; 98, etc, butafull pause at the end of the hfth foot
of the hexameter, as in 1, 4, 27 and 63 ; 1, 5, 61 and 753 1, 9,
11 (not in book 2), was always rare in careful writers. Charac-
teristic of Tibullus here, as we should expect, is the special em-
phasis upon parallelism between the two verses. The thought falls
into two parts, and the fact is emphasized, ag„ by contrasting
negative and positive or vice versa (r, 1, 9-10 ,· 37-38; 67-68 ;
2, 15—163 23-243 63-645'4, 21-22, etc). Less common in
Propertius, and usually modilied and extended as in 1, 2, 15—22 3
23-24, etc.

Another very common method of marking the relation was
by the use of contrasted epithets. This is of course charac- ,
teristic of the distich as a whole, but it is especially notable in
the distich of Tibullus (ι, 1, 21-22 ; 45-46 3 47-483 2, 17—183
4, 11—123 49-50 ; 5, 67—68, and often).

All these aspects of the sentence within the distich are found
also in the versatile Ovid. But Ovid is not simple in the manner
of Tibullus, nor emotional in the manner of Propertius. He has
the grace, rapidity, and variety of one who was at once a highly
trained rhetorician and a natural story-teller. These qualities
are reflected in the variety ol his sentences, but especially in
the brief, snappy sentence-the solution of a long period into
a series of separate statements without connecting particles—
which is peculiarly Ovidian and foreshadows the rhetoric of the
Silver Age (Amores, 3, 4, 1-1o; 2, 10, 1 ff.; Ars Amat. 2,
144-160, etc).

The distich also had an equally strong influence upon the
arrangement of the words within the sentence itself. The full
