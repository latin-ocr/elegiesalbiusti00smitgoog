TlBVLLVS

development os this art constitutes one os the most important
contributions os the Alexandrinus to the teghnique of the dis·
ticli. It was mainly caused by the fact that when the elegy
became descriptive it naturally returned to lyric, and borrowed
its bolder and more artiul arrangement os words. The object
of all such arrangement was to bring out not only the relation
of hexameter to pentameter, but also, within each verse, os
hemistieh to hemistich. Among these phenomena we may
mention-

1. The arrangement os a noun and its adjective at the ends
respectively os the two hemistichs, thus, 1, 1, a:

t. et teneat culti l iugera multa soli,

or 1, r, 21:

tunc vitula innumeros Ι lustrabat caesa iuvencos,

(much more frequent in the pentameter than in the hexameter).
Ii the words belong to the same declension, the result is an
assonance which serves to impress the relation on the ear. The
frequency of this assonance in the Alexandrian poets is notable.
Orthe 49 pentameters in the one long fragment oi Herme-
sianax (Athen. 597), no less than 26 are examples oi it. Prob-·
ably Philetas belonged to the same class. In the hymn of
Kallimachos to Pallas 16 os the ²5 pentameters so constructed
(out os a total ol 71) contain assonance. A similar situation in
the elegies of Catullus shows his study os Alexandrian models.
The frequency of it in highly descriptive passages, eg, 66, 13 ff,
is also significant. Alter Catullus all the elegiae poets con-
stantly use this device. Os the three, Tibullus is freest in
the pentameter, Propertius in the hexameter. With all, the ar-
rangement adj.-subst. is much more common than subst.-adj.
Rasi's figures lor the pentameter are: Tibullus, adj.—subst.,
3835 per cent ; subst.-adj., 3.33 per cent. Propertius, adj.-

subst.,' 38.or per cent; subst.- adj, 7.28 per cent. Ovid,
Amores, adj.—subst., 2461 per cent; subse-adj, 11.48 per
104
