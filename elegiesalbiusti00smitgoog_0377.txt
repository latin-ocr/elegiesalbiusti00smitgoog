· notion of prolongation, protraction, beyond the necessary or regular time is
suggested by the context rather than inherent in the verb itself, cp. Hor. A.
P. 376, ‘poterat duci quia cena sine istis,' ‘because a dinner could be con·
ducted, could continue, without those things? So of trahere in the same
connection, asin 2, 3, 47. So too of Cicero’s ‘ducere aetatem litteris: of
Vergil’s ‘ducere vitam,’ ⁴even of his ‘producere vitam’ (cp. our own expres·
sion ‘to lead a sedentary life,’ eto). ln many of these exx. the idea at the

v bottom is the continuity of the action 61 state. Cp. eg. 1, 4, 5, ‘hibernae

producis frigora brumae¹ (in which ‘hibernae frigora brumae’ is really an
expression of time) with Ter. Adel. 591, ‘cyathos sorbilans paulatim hunc
producam diem!

62. Ovid, Fasti, 1, 456, ‘quod tepidum vigili provocet ore diem’ ; Pont.
1, 4, 58, ‘quam primum roseo provocet ore diem.'-10ta Luciferi: Lucifer,
61 Phosphoros, brightest and most glorious of all the stara (Ovid, Trist. 1, 3,
72; Met. 2, 723), rises from the Eastern Sea (Fare. 6, 474; Pont. 2, 5, 50)
and summoue (hence provocet here) the Day, putting to flight the throng of
lesser stara (Met. 2, 115). He is constantly referred to (aa here) as the
Herald of the Dawn (so regularly in the Anth. Pal.; cp. 12,'114, 1, Ἠοῦς
ἄγγελε, χαῖρε, Φωσφόρε· Ovid, Her. 18, 112, tpraevius Aurorae’; eto).
He is given wings by lon, frag. 7Crus. 'Aoior ἀεροφοίταν ἀστέρα Ι ,armna
dalton λευκοπτέρνγα πρόδρομον· cp. Ovid, Aneor. 1, 6, 65, quoted below, 616.
According to another and probably later conception, he rides a horse, Ovid,
Amor. 2, 11, 56, etc, quoted in 1, 3, 93-94 n.; Met. 15, 189, ‘cumque albo
Lucifer exit Ι carus equ0’; Stat. Theb. 6, 240; Claud. 8, 5623 De Ropt. Pras.
2,122; etc. The attribute of a chariot, which 11 doubtless Hellenistic, but
occurs 11616 (cp. also 1, 3, 94) 161 the first time, is confined to the Roman
poets and is not supported by the remains of antique art; cp. Ovid, Amor.
1, 6, 65, ‘iamque pruinosus molitur Lucifer axes, Ι inque suurn miseros ex·
citat ales opus' (why does awinged god incommode himself with a chariot ?);
Eleg. in Maec. 1325 ete. See C. Pascal, Bollettino di Filologia Classica, 15,
p. 114. -rotn 11,· chariot.' For the poetic'singular (cp. 1, 1, 42 11.) and
161 the figure (pars pro toto), Ovid, Ars Amat. 2, 2305 Met. 1, 448 ; Propert.
2, 25, 26; etc.

⁶3· illa: 161 the ablat. with comparatives, see also 1, 8, 3¹3 4, 8, 3.— 1
queat: potential, ‘no one could, etc, better than she? - consumere . . ,1111- y

posuisse: 1,1,29-32n. Possibly no conscious distinction was made in this

instance. Note, however, that the perfect disposuisse here would, if felt, ¹

emphasize the completion of the list and therefore be more insulting. nulius
is to be taken with both verbs.
