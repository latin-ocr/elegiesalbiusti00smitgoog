48. Mother Earth has her hair cut, ie. of course, the grain is reaped. Α
variation of the more common coma = the foliage of the trees, cp. ι, 7, 34 n.
Tibullus is followed eg. by Ovid, Amor. 3, 10, 11, ‘prima Ceres docuit tur·
gescere semen in agris Ι falce coloratos subsecuitque comas! In the Pemig.
Ven. 4, we have another version of it,‘ vere concordant amores, vere nubunt
alites, Ι etaemus comam resolvit de maritis imbribus! '‘The beautiful uneut
hair of graves’ (perpetrated by Walt Whitrnan, ‘Song of Myself’) illustratas
the effect of the figure used by Tibullus when appearing in English-annua:
ie. quotannis, adjective for adverb. This use of the adjective (poetieal) is simi·
lar to that of verno in the next line.

49-50. Regarding honey and the nature and habits of bees see r, 3, 45 n. κ
ln this passage stores stands of course for sucus storum. The bees do not carry y
off the flowers, they extract something from the flower. We should say of ³
course that that something was the honey, and the following lines would j
appear to indicate that Tibullus agrees with the modern view, which indeed ³

had already been promulgated before his time. Another view, however, was
widely disseminated. It is clearly set forth eg. by Aristotle, De AriimaIHist.
5, 22, 4 (passage quoted in 1, 3, 45 n). According to this view the combs
were made from the flowers, the honey fell from the skies, cp. also Verg. G. 4,
39; Pliny, 11,11ff.

49. verno: the worlr of the bees at this period and in the fall is discussed
at length by Columella, 9, 14 and Palladius, 7, 7. —alveoz pronounced here as

, a dissyllabis, The only case of synaeresis in Tibullus, ep. Introd..p. 100.

51-58. Here, ton, among rustics inspired by their desire to do honour to
their gods on holy days are to be found the beginnings of music, song, and
the dance, from which the tragedy was afterward developed, cp. 1, 7, 37-42 n.
The subject was much discussed at this time, and the statements and con·
clusions of the Roman scholare, especially as regards the origin and develop-
ment of their own drama, have given rise to much discussion in the last few
years. For a thoroughgoing examination and criticism of the destructive
theories of Leo and Hendrickson‚ see Charles Knapp‚ A. s. P. 33 (1912), 125 ff.
ΤῙιε substance of Varro’s account probably survives in Diomedes (Com. Dar.
p. 57, Kaibel), ‘Tragoedia ut quidam, a τράγῳ et ᾠδῇ dicta est, quoniam olim
auctoribus tragicis τράγος, id est, hircus, praemium cantus proponebatur qui
Liberalibus die festo Libero patri ob hoc ipsum immolabatur quia, ut Varro

ait, depascunt vitem; et Horatius in Arte Poetica (220) et Vergilius in
Georgicon 2 (380). . . alii autem putant afaece, quam Graecorum quidam
τρύγα appellant, tragoediam nominatam, per mutationem litterarum v in a
versa, quoniam olim, nondum personis a Thespide repertis, tales fabulas per·
uncti ora faecibus agitabant, ut rursum est Horatius testis (A. P. 275·277).
