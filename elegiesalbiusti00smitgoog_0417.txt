dicenda bona sunt bona verba die¹; Trist. 5, 5, 6; esp. Cicero, Div. 1,102,
‘neque solum deorum voces Pythagorici observitaverunt‚ sed etiam hominum,
quae vocant omina. quae maiores nostri quia valere censebant, idcirco
omnibus rebus agendis “quod bonurn faustum felix fortunatumque esset ”
praefabantur, rebusque divinis quae publica fierent, ut “faverent linguis”
imperabatur inque seriis imperandis, ut “litibus et iurgiis se abstinerent.’'

itemque in lustranda colonia ab eo qui eam deduceret, et cum imperator 3
exercitum, censor populum lustraret, bonis nominibus, qui hostias ducerent }
eligebantur, quod idem in delectu consules observant ut primus miles fiat ι

bono nomine,' etc.

For the caesura cp. 1, 2, 27 n. Ot' the 25 cases in Tibullus no less than
four (1; 33 93 21) occur in this elegy.

2. 1, 6, 39 n.-vir mulierque: tle. ‘omnes quisquis ades,’ ep. e.g.0vid, ι

Ibis, 118, ‘gaudeat adversis femina virque tuis) This methodos emphasizing
the idea of totality by enumerating the tactors of which it is composed isan
interesting paragraph in the history of any language. Such combinations are
generally phraseological. ln a vast number ol cases the choice os the factors
is determined by alliteration, ep. 1, 10, 65 n. Again the influence of some
metaphor‚ ete., is to be considered. The order ot arrangement is generally
due to considerations oi euphony and offers a strong resistance to change.
Our arrangement, for example, ot' ‘laith, hope, charity' (1 Cor. 13, 13), is
fixed, and corresponds to that of both Greek (πίστις, ἐλπὶς, ἀγάπη) aud Latin
(ι fides, spes, caritas ’). Cp. also ‘men, women, and children,’ ‘gentle and
simple,’ ‘bond and free,’ ‘all sorts and conditions,’ etc.

3. Martial’s ‘pia tura’ in 8, 8, 3 is cited by Friedldnder asan imitation os
this line-drantir . . . artatur: 1, 8, 1311.

4. tenor Arabs: the classical writers habitually ascribe effeminacy to the
Orientals, cp. Catull. 11, 5; Verg. G. 1, 57 (with the note of Servius) ; Manil.
4, 6543 etc. On Arabia as the land of persumes see 1, 3, 7n.; 4, 2, 17-18.
-diviter rie. ‘the possessor of riches,' not fertilis. The Arabian has the
proverbial wealth os the Oriental, cp. 1, 1, 51 n.

5. Genifrsz 1, ιο, ι3; ι, 5, 33 and notes-adsit: 1, 1, 37-38 n.-
visurus: this use os the future participle active to express purpose appeared
as early as C. Gracchus, acc. to Gellius, 11, 10, 4, who cites ‘qui prodeunt dis·
suasuri' srom one oi his speeehes. But although exit. like Cicero, Verr. 1,
56, ‘Servilius adest de te sententiam laturus' (which is much like the era
besore us) may be called an extension oi the periphrastic conjugation, it
points the way, as Schmalz says, to the regular use especially with verbs ot
