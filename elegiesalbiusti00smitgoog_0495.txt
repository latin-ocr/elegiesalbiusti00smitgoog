Burton (see 7-10 n. below) takes up this important question at great length
and fortifies it as is his wont by many quotations.

Sometimes this same catholicity ol taste is made the excuse for inconstancy,
cp. Ovid, Amor. 2, 43 Propert. 2, ²²3 etc. Or, thanlrs to an unexpected com·
pliment, the very wealrness itsels becomes as it were a virtue, asin Sedley’s-

All tlrat in woman is adored
In thy dear sels I lind-

For the whole sex can but allord
Τὴε handsome and the kind.

Why then should Ι seelr further stote,
And still make love anew?

When change itselt’ can give no more,
'Tis easy ro be truel

7-10. Burton quotes these lines in his ‘ Symptoms ot' Love’ (Anat. Mel.
Part 111, Sect. ΙΙ, Mem. 111, Subsect. I) and translates:

What e'er she doth, or whither e'er she go,
A sweet and pleasing grace attends lorsooth;
Or loose, or bind her hair, or cornb it up,
She's to be honoured in what she doth.

‘vestem induitur, formosa est; exuitur, tota forma est,' he continues (trans-
lating from Aristainetos, Epist. r, 1, ἐνδεδυμένη μὲν εὐπροσωποτάτη ἐστίν,
ἐκδῦσα δὲ ὅλη πρόσωπον φαίνεται), ‘let her be dressed or undressed, all is
one, she is excellent still, beautiful, fair, and lovcly to behold. Women do
as much by men, nay more, far londer, wealrer, and that by many parasangs,’
etc. llerriclr says-

Whenas in siliis my Julia goes.
Their, then, methinlrs, how sweetly flows
The liquefaction ol her clothes.

Next, when I cast mine eyes, and see
That brave vibration, each way free,
Ο, how that glittering talieth mel

8. componit: lit. ‘arrange,’ 'set in order,’ i.e. ‘adorn’ Derived from

the use os componere to describe the feminine toilet, cp. eg. Ovid, Met. 4, 318 ’

(ol Salmacis-upon seeing Hermaphroditos), ‘ nec tamen ante adiit etsi pro·
perabat adire, Ι quam se composuit, quam circumspexit amictus, Ι et finnt
vultum, et meruit formosa videri: etc. Decor here is thought of as the maid
who makes her mistress presentable under all circumstances and accompanies
her (subsequitur) without our knowledge (furtim). Possibly we hear the
echo os this passage in Quintil. 1,11, 19, ‘neque enim gestum oratoris com·
