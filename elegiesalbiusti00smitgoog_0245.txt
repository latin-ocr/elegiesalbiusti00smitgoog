days after the planels was then general throughout the world, especially at
Rome itself. Maass points out that the Germanic days of the weelr go back
to at least as early as 300 mn. The peculiarity of the Hellenistic week, as
seen from the Pompeian inscription quoted above, is that it began on Satur-
day. The change to Sunday was made by the Christians and isa return to
ibe old Jewiyh system.. For the various objections of both Christiana and
Pagans to this rival of the old Roman weelr of nine days, see especially
Maass, lc. with notes ani references.

- sierint: elsewhere, Tibullus scans this word either as sacri or sacra, and
if we adopt Saturnive sacram, the emended reading generally accepted since
Broukhusius, even this one exception is removed; hence Wiilfflin's conclusion
(cp. Arclr'iufi Lat. Lexlkograpliie, 8, 420; Wiener Slud. 7, 164) that this was
actually arule of Tibullian usage. Rasi, however, in his searching examina-
*tion of this aspect of our poet's art (⁴ De positione debili quae vocatur seu de
syllabae ancipitis ante mutam curn liquida usu apud Tibullum,’ Reudiconti del
Reale [stilulo lombardico, 40, 65 3, cp. Tolllriehn, Berlin. Philologisclre Wochen·
schrrst, 32, p. 3943 cp. also, G. Lupi, Bollettino di Filologia Classica, 9, 231), has
shownthat Tibullus's usage here was a matterof accident not design. Thereis
no reason in the world why he should not have avalled himself of the lreedom
which his friends, Vergil and Horace, allowed themselves in the use of this
word (cp. eg. Sat. 1‚9,1; 1,5,99; 0u2‚13,29; Curm.Saec.4; Verg. G.
3, 334; A. 2, 525³ 3,1; ro, 5385 11, 533, ete). The text of the Arn-
brosianus in this distich is clear and satisfactory as it stands, and I have not Δ
hesitated to follow Vahlen (Tibullus, Haupt-Vahlen, 6th edit. fs.) in
adopting it.-tenursse: for retinuisse, see 44 n. But this is not uncommon
in Livy’s prose, cp. 3, 2, 1, with H. J. Miiller’s note.

19-20. Stumbling has always been an evil omen, especially at the begin-
ning of anything (ingressus iter) and above all, on the threshold (inportu).
Ovid, Met. ιο, 452 (of Myrrha), ‘ ter pedis offensi signo est revocata, ter omen Ι
funereus bubo letali carmine fecit’; Amor. 1,12, 33 Her. 13, 88; T risi. 1.
3, 553 Val. Max. 1, 4,2 (quoted above); Verg. A. 2, 24² (with Forbiger's
note), Pliny, H. Ν. 2, 24, etc. Hence to prevent the possibility ol stumbling,
the Roman bride was lifted over the threshold of her new home; see Catull.
61, 159 (with the notes of Riese and Ellis), anri cp. Plaut. Cas. 815 (witha
comic application) ‘sensim super attolle limen pedes, nova nupta; (sospes
iter incipe hoc, uti viro tuo Ι semper sis superstes,’ etc.

ar-aa. A general truth serving as the conclusion of lines 9-20. Delia’s
real reason for anxiety (13-14) was love. Tibullus’s real reason for lingering
—the others were merely alleged (causatus)—was love. Love alone was
plainly against a journey during which, as it turns out, the poet has fallen dan·
