The sistrum was shaken, not struck, hence repulsa here shows an extensior
of use similar-though less violent- to that of pulsa in 1, 1, 4 (cp. note).
But repulsa here is justified hythe fact that with the more usual metonymy of
aera, i.e. cymbals, it is the proper word (as'eg. in 1, 8, 22). Moreover,
though the sistrum was shaken, the sound so produced is more suggestive of
striking. For the evidently iterative sense of repulsa cp. Ovid, Met. 3, 533,
etc. '

25. quidve: supply prodest (from prosunt above) and construe lavari and
secubuisse with it. memini is parenthetical. For the combination of perf.
and pres. infin. 1, 1, 29-32n.-lavari . . . accubuisset these observances, one
or both, are immemorial in religious ritual, cp. Homer, Odyss. 17, 58, ἡ δ’ ὑδρη-
ναμένη, καθαρὰ χροῒ εἵμαθ’ ἑλοῦσα, Ι εὔχετο πᾶσι θεοῖσι· 4, 75ο; Tib. 2, 1,

leg. 2, 24; Pers. 2, 15; etc. ln the worship of lsis they were especially
prominent. Ceremonial bathing was very frequent (cp. Juv. 6, 522, etc.)
and was often accompanied by sprinkling with water from the Nile (Juv. l.c.)
or its representative (Servius on Verg. A. 2, 116, eto). The secubitus,
which is often mentioned by the elegiae poets (1, 6, 113 Propert. 2, 33,“ι ; 4,
5, 34; Ovid, Amor. 1, 8, 74; 2, 19,42; 3, 9, 343 Juv. 6, 5 3⁶3 Apul. Met. 11,
23; eto), lasted ten days (Propert. 2, 33, 2, cp. the neuvaines of the modern
church), and the devotee usually went into retreat in the temple during this
period (Propert. l.c., etc). They were a preparation for the ⁸ sacri observan-
dique dies’ (Juv. 6, 536), the festivals or special seasons devoted to the
goddess and her worship. .

Isis is here addressed as the goddess of healing, one of the most important
of her many functions and frequently mentioned. The numerous err-votos in
her temple, each the thank·offering of one who has been cured by her, are so

many testimonials to her power as a lwaler. Exvotos of this class often con· ι

sisted of models of the diseased part and many have been found in the temple

of Isis at Pompeii and elsewhere. Paintings, however, pictae tabellae, were t
habitually used for err-votos of all sorts, hut especially by those who had .
escaped the perils of the sea, cp. Cicero, N. D: 3, 893 Hor. A. P. 2ος ete3 l
hence, often in connection with Isis as the goddess of seafarers, ag. Juv. 12, Ἴ

' 27. posse: supply te, ep. 1, 5, 73 n.; 2, 6, 13 n. The parenthetical excuse,
as it were, for the prayer is frequent and characteristic, cp. 513 Verg. A. 6,
’ ιι7; Homer, Odyrs. 4, 237, etc.

28. multa: ‘many a' (so 2, 3, 42; 2, 5, 72) is a use characteristic of
· poetry and post-Augustan prose, cp. 1, 1, 42 and 1, 9. 68 with notes.

29. ut: consecutive, r'.e. Tib. promises that ‘if Isis cures him Delia shall,’
