4, r 3, 13] TIBVLLVS

13-14. Professor Mastard reminds me that these lines are echoed by
Sannazaro, Eleg. 1, 3, 1-2-‘nulla meos poterit mulier praevertere sensus,
Ι ipsa licet caelum linquat et astra Venus!

¹³· -1, 3, 89-90 is regularly quoted here, indeed Professor Postgate (again
assuming that his theory of. priorityis proved) says that the ‘writer seems to
be awkwardly imitating a beautiful distich of Tibullus, 1, 3, 89 f.’ Τὴε par·
allelism between these two passages is confined solely to caelo missus iu 1, 3,
90, and e caelo mittatur here. But caelo missus in 1, 3, 90 (to express the
totally unexpected, cp. our ‘dropped from the clouds') isone of the corn·
monest proverbial phrases in the Latin language (cp. note ad loc). One
does not imitate proverbs. As a matter of fact, too, e caelo mittatur in our
passage has nothing to do with the proverbial caelo minus. The meaning is
‘if a mistress were fetched me from heaven itself,’ etc, ie. ‘a goddess instead
of a mortal woman such as you are,’a type of hyperbole common enough
among lovers, cp. Ovid‚ Met. 7, 800, ‘mutua cura duos et amor socialis habe·
bat, Ι nec lovis illa meo thalamos praeferret amori, Ι nec me quae caperet,
non si Venus ipsa veniret, Ι ulla erat’3 Catuli. 72, 1, ‘dicebas quondam solum
te nosse Catullum, Ι Lesbia, nec prae me velle tenere Iovem' ς Ovid‚ Her.
4, 35, ‘si mihi concedat Iuno fratremque virumque, Ι Hippolytum videor prae-
positura lovi’; Plautus, Casina, 323, ‘negavi enim ipsi me concessurum
Iovi, Ι si is mecum oraret'; Catull. 70, 1, ‘nulli se¹ dicit mulier mea nu·
bere malle Ι quam mihi, non si se Iuppiter ipse petat’ ; ‘But might 1 of
Jove's nectar sup, 1 would not change for thine,’ etc. ‘Tite idea of hav·
ing a mistress sent down from heaven,’ continues Professor Postgate, ‘is used
much more appropriately by Apuleius,' Met. 2, 8, ‘si cuiuslibet eximiae pul·
cherrimaeque feminae caput capillo spoliaveris et faciem nativa specie nuda·
veris, licet illa caelo deiecta, mari edita, fluctibus educata, licet inquam Venus
ipsa fuerit, . . . placere non poterit nec Vulcano suo.’ But caelo deiecta, the
words italicized by Professor Postgate, have nothing whatever to do with the
idea of e caelo mittatur, ‘a mistress sent from the clouds,' still less with caelo
missus, the proverbial ‘dropped from the clouds,’ As the connection shows,
as the participle deiecta in itself suggests, Apule'ius is simply referring to the
well-known legend of the birth of Venus herself, the phrase is merely one of
the three items in his description of her. - Tibullo: 4, 8, 2 n.
