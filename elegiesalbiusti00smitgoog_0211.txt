1, r, 75] Ἴ TIBVLLVS

r, 8, 95, ‘non bene, si tollas proelia, durat amor,' etc. On the lovers’ quarrel
as'a theme of the elegy aee r, 6, 73-74 and 2, 5, 101-4 with notes. -inse-
ruisse: ‘intersperse’ So Ovid, Amor. 3, 7, 7 ; Livy, 35,17, 2; Tac. Hirr.
1, 23, etc.

75. hic: ‘here,' ae. on the fieldof love, 35 1.-(11111 milesque bonus: 2
military phrase osten repeated in various forms, indicating the highest
efficiency in a soldier, cp. the Homeric ἀμφότερον βασιλεύς τ’ ἀγαθὸς κρατερός
τ’ αἰχμητής and eg. in epitaphs, as Carm. Epig. 1525, 2, B, 'miles bonus, o
dea, duxque hic idern suit: perhaps a reminiscence ol this line-bonus:
agrees with the nearest ol its two nouus, so 1, 1, ²4 ; 1, 5, 36 (see ri.); plural

in r,4, 37. Cp. r, 3, 2n.
77-78. Cp. Petrarcb’s allusion (Eclog. 9, 206) to Tibullus as—

paupertas quem tuta iuvet, quem Delius ardor.

The line might have been suggested either by this distich or possibly by 5-6
above. Unfortunately‚ however, both disticha are contained in the Flori-
legia (Introd. p. 89). It is therefore still uncertain whether Petrarch ever
saw a complete MS. oi our poet (Introd. p. 63).

77. acervo: sor this meaning of the word, lior. Od. 2, 2, 24; Epist. 1, 6,
353 Juv. 8, 100, etc.

78. Perhaps Horace, Epist. 1, 4, 11, had this line in his mind. See Introd.
p. 32. Pohlenz, p. roo (l.c. in Introd. to r, 1, above), cites Theognis, 559;
Kallimach. vol. 2, p. 182, Schn.

The type oi anaphora-so also 1,4, 823 1, 7, 643 2, 5, 100 and 1ο5;
2, 6, 93 Ovid, Her. 4, 112, etc. - echoes what appears to have been a favourite
rhetorical device of the Alexandrian poets. So Theokrit. 1, 132 (with
l'ritzsche's note); 7, 353 9, 173 15, 5, etc.

1,2

Tffls elegy, with which the contributione of Propertius (1, 16) and Ovid
(Amores, 1, 6) to the same type should be compared, is an artistic variation
upon the old conventional motive of the παρακλαυσίθυρονς see 7-14‚ below
and note. For the setting, see Introd. p. 45.

Imitated by Loyson and Parny.

‘Fetch me more wine. l would sleep and lorget my woes. My love is
closely watched and the heartless door is loclred and barred. Thou churlish
door, may curses light upon thee! Nay, 1 spoke in my haste, I prithee forgive
me. T hou shouldst remember the many wreaths l have hung upon thee in
other days. Yon too, Delia, evade your guards and sear not. Venus favours
