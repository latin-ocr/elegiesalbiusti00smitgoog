is regularly used of those who become gods at death. All agree also that he 3
died near the Numicius, cp. Cassius Hemina, srag. 7, ‘apud Numicium parere i
desiit. . . patris Indigetis ei nomen datum! So Varro (Augustin. C. D. 18, ¹

‘19)‚ Diodorus, and Cassius Dio, cp. Verg. A. 4, 6203 ovid, Met. 14, 597. But ,
the doubt of the younger annalists (eg. Sisenna, frog.3 P.) regarding the
subsequent divinity of Aeneas is reflected iu Iustinus, 43, 1, 10; Appian
Rom. Hirr. 1, 13 Servius on Verg. Α. 1, 259. It is referred to by Dionys. Hal

1, 64 and has affected Livy, 1, 2, 6, ‘secundum inde proelium Latinis, Aeneae, ,

etiam ultimum mortalium operum fuit. situs est quemcumque eum dici ius
fasque est, super Numicum fluvium, lovem Indigetem appellant) 111e very

uncertainty thus produced regarding the ultimate faie of Aeneas lends addi· l

tional power to Dido's famous curse, A. 4, 612-620, the close of which is,
‘nec curn se sub leges pacis iniquae Ι tradiderit, regno aut optata luce
fruatur, {sed cadat ante diem mediaque inhumatus harena! Nor does Vergil ¹
himself remove the uncertainty in so many words until A. 12, 794. Later i
the account was embellished with further details indicative of Aeneas’s
approaching diviuity (Ovid‚ Met. l.c. ,· Origo Gentis Romanae, 14, 2).

43. veneranda unda miserit: au allusion to the belief that it was through
¹ the boly water of the Numicius itself that Aeneas was prepared for immor·

tality. So Juvenal, 11, 63 (speaking of Aeneas aud Hercules), ‘alter aquis 1
alter flammis ad sidera missus', Ovid, Met. 14, 598, ete-Numici: so ἶ

Lavini (49) and Servi (4, 10, 4). The later gen. in ii of -r'o- stemsis
not frequent until Propertius. As Numicius is felt to be a god the genis
possessive, cp. 1, 7, 57¹1·

44. deum indigetem: the precise functions ofa deus indiges and the
meaning of the word itself were not clear to the scholare of the Augustan
Age and have been discussed at great length in modern times. Most con-
vincing perhaps is R. Peter (Roscher's Lexikou, etc, 3, 137), ‘Indrges (from
indu -1- og) describes a god whose power is exerted solely and entirely upon
one specific mortal activity‚ or only in certain definite circumstances, or only
in a certain given place,’ etc. Hence Iuppiter Inda'ges, afterward Aeneas
ludiges, as the specific deity of the Numicius. This theory of divine speciali-
zation was pontifical rather than popular (cp. Servius on Verg. A. 2, 141, ‘pon-
tifices dieunt singulisuctibus proprios deos praeesse’). It was carried out to
the utmost degree of minuteness, and the deity in each case received a name
which described his one specific function, ag. Abeona, the goddess who pro-
tects children the first time they leave the house, but Adeoua‚ the goddess
