INTRODUCTION r

inimitable mockery of 1, 6, the twinkle ol amusement in r, 8, the
whimsical observation ol 2, 1, 79-86, the affectionate raillery ol
2, 2, the genuine Alexandrian persiflage ol 2, 6, 1 ff.

It seems to be the general opinion that Tibullus lacked the
energy or the ambition, or possibly even the ability, to add those
last touches to his elegies that would have made them perfect
works of art according to his own standard. It is urged in sup·
port ol this opinion that, clear as heis, he is not always clear, that
he sometimes repeats the same word too frequently, that there are
occasional freedoms in his versification which are not found to the
same extentio standard technique (tle. in Ovid’s technique), etc.
This may be true, but it is yet to be proved. Whatever our
modern point of view may be, the opinion remains a mere asser-
tion until we can show that the peculiarities cited in its support
actually were inconsistent with his own ideal ol literary art.

A recent critic is inclined to place Tibullus among poets of the
seco'nd ranlr.l This may be true. But it is difficult to detine
accurately the genius ol Tibullus, and even more difficult perhaps
to detine just what constitutes a poet ol the second rank. Mod-
ern criticism for example would doubtless award the tirst rank
to Browning, the second to Gray and Collins. More than one
reputable reader however would not exchange the Tibullian grace
of the ‘Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard' or the Simoni-
dean simplicity of ‘How Sleep the Brave’ sor all the verses
Browning ever wrote or was capable of writing.

Here however we are concemed, not with the position ol Ti-
bullus in the wider domain os poetry as such, but merely with his
position in the elegy. This is also the question with which Quin-
tilian was concemed. His reply was, ‘elegia quoque Graecos
provocamus, cuius mihi tersus atque elegans maxime videtur
auctor Tibullus. sunt qui Propertium malint. Ovidius utroque

lascivior, sicut durior Gallus!
lThe best characterization is given by Sellar‚ Lc. p. 237. An adequate discus·

sion ol the views ol Rothstein. Pichon‚ and especially Jacoby on this question ¹

would require more space than can be given to it here.
