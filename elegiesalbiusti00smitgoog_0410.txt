37, ‘tortaque versato ducentes stamina fuso ’ς Met. 4, 34, ‘aut ducunt lanas
aut stamina pollice 'versant¹, etc. The impetus given to tbe spindle
was prolonged by a weight at the bottom. As the new thread lengthened,
tbe spindle of course approached the ground. At convenient intervals
therefore the new thread was wound up on the spindle and the process re·
peated as before. The spinning wheel of our grandmothers was more rapid
and convenient, but the process was very much the same.

For pensa see 1,3, 87 n. .

65-66. The ancient loom was vertical and the tela or warp hung down
from the upper cross bearn. Sinkere (pondera, Sen. Epist. 90, 20, here lateres
because made of balred clay) were attached to the several threads to keep
them taut and equidistant. Every time a thread of the woof was driven
horne by the comb or ‘lay' (pecten, ‘wool’ is subtemen) the lateres of course
rattled against each other, hence ‘applauso tela sonat latere! For a com·
plete description of the process see Ovid‚ Met. 6, 54.

6⁶. cantat: 2, 6, 26 n. The classic writers contain many references to
women singing at their work. The prototype is Homer, Odyss. 5, 61 (Ka-
lypso); 10, 221 (Kirke). See also, among other references, Eurip. lphig.

· ⁴0, fellow, come, the song we had last night.
Mark it, cesario, it is old and plain;
The spinsters and the knitters in the suu
And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth, .
And dallies with the innocence of love,
Like tbe old age!

⁶7-8a. Ceres, Bacchos. the Lares, Minerva, have all received their due
mention. The poet reserves his surprise for the end, although the reference
to woman’s work in the preceding lines effecta an easy transition to it—
‘Cupid, τοο, was born in the country and served his apprenticeship there.’
In this way Tibullus returns to the conventional atmosphere of the erotic
elegy and then (81 f.) to the festivities of the day and bis conclusion. In
tone, as well as in thought, the passage has touches which remind one by
turns of the epigram, the comedy‚ and the pastoral, as well as of the elegy itself
as a department. Here, too, should be reckoued the l’ervrgr'lr'um Veneris.
