native tribes. The expedition was a brilliant success, audon
Sept. 25, 27 s..,c he received the honourof a triumph ex Gallia.
Apparently his birthday fell at or near the same date. At all
events Tibullus’s present to his patron on that occasion was a
congratulatory poem (now r, 7)‚' m which he describes the expe·
dition, and tells us that he himself took part in it. ‘Non sine me
est tibi partus honos’ (1, 7, 9), Ἰ, too, contributed to the honour
which thou hast won‚’ he says very simply. Yet the vita tells us
that he was decorated for distinguished service — ‘ militaribus donis
donatus est.'

Messalla was also sent out by Octavianus to settle the disturbed
affairs of the Orient. The poet was invited to take part iu this
campaign as a member of Messalla’s stall (1, 3), but fell sick at
Corcyra, and apparently did not proceed with the journey. It is
generally supposed that this is the expedition to which he refers in
r, r, but in which he had at that time refused to take part. This
however is quite incapable of proos. Nor can we say whether the
mission to the East occurred before or after the Aquitaniau cam·
paign. Itis to be hoped that we may yet discover inscriptional
evidence for this important question. If so, we might establish the
chronological sequence of 1, r ; 1, 3 ; and 1, 7and possibly of 1, 10.
Until then no further light cau be shed upon the military career of
our poet. r, ιο for example is addressed to no one, and refers to
no one. All we know is that he was on the eve of a campaign.
Is it the campaign ending with Actium, or was he thinking of the
expedition to Aquitania? Both have been suggested (see note on
r, ro, 25).

Messalla was equally distinguished as a man of affairs. Some-

time before his triumph he was commissioned by Augustus to repair
a portion of the Via Latina. He performed the work so thoroughly
that more than a century later (ι, 7, 57, and notes) it wasa
proverb of durability. A rare apotheosis for a road commissioner.
ln 26 Augustus created the new and important office of praefectus
urbi. The first incumbent chosen was Messalla, but Hieronymus
