theme, already touched upon (5-10), of the Civil Wars, which ior years had
threatened to destroy the chief glory oi that prediction. ‘Other Sibyls-and

their words were only too true-loretold the horrors oi that time. But all Ἴ

that is past now.'

The identity of the various Sibyls had been so much discussed and so many
different conclusione reached (15 n.) that one cannot be sure which ones the
poet means by the names he uses. Servius on Verg. A. 6, 72, ior instance,
says that Amalthea (Ἀμαλθαία, Suidas; Ἀμάλθεια, Lydus) was the Sibyl
who sold the books to Tarquin‚ aud others add (Lydus, De Mens. 4, 47) that
the books she oilered were the oracles oi the Cumaeau Sibyl. Varro identified
this Amalthea with the Sibyl of Cumae, who, he adds, had also been called
Herophile or Demophile. See line 19 n. ‘Marpesia Herophile’ (cp. lactant.
l.c.; Suidas, av. Ἡροφίλη and Σίβυλλα ; Pansan. 10, 12, 2) would be the Trojan
Sibyl born at Marpessos, but claimed by Erythrae (see her epitaph in Pausan.
l.c. and the dispute oi the two towns with regard to it). Her grave was in

the close of Apollo Smintheus in the Troad. On her prophecy to Aeneas see Ἴ
Dionys. Hal. 1, 55, 4. She was also claimed ior Klaros, Samos, Delos, i

Delphi, and even Cumae. lndeed it was she, according to some, who sold

the books to Tarquin. ‘Phyto Graia' (ae. in distinction from Herophile, who J
was Trojan) was the Sibyl oi Samos (Lydus, l.c.; Schol. on Plato, Phaidros, 244 ,

13; Clemens Alex. Strom. 1, 399 Ρ.). It will be seen that uo really satisfactory
conclusion can be reached. The definite point iu mentioning these Sibyls
here (four, including Albunea in 69-70), is that, whatever may bave been
their identity in' the poet's mind, they represent the Sibyls whose oracles bad
been accepted hythe commission oi 76 tac. and included in the new conec,
tion at that time.

69-70. The Sibyl of Tibur (Tiburs) is Albunea, the Carmentis of Vergil,
A. 8, 336, the prophetess oi Tibur, nymph os the Aquae Albulae, rising in the
modern Lago della Solfatara and emptying into the Anio. Somewhere upon
it was the oracle of Faunus (Verg. A. 7, 81). The Grotto oi Albunea,
Horace’s ⁸ domus Albuneae resonantis’ (Oa'. 1, 7, 12) was probably near the
wateriall or perhaps nearer the Anio. Modern tradition identifies it with the
‘Cave oi the Sibyl! When the cult oi the Sibyls came to Latium, Albunea
became a Sibyl and Laetant. l.c. says that she was worshipped as a goddess
on the hanks ol the Anio at Tibur. Hence probably the famous ‘Temple ol
the Sibyl’ at Tivoli on the edge oi the precipice below the falls oi the Anio.
The miracle mentioned by our poet was doubtless a local legend oi Tibur
(Tivoli) and it is also evidently referred to by Laetant. (ie. Varro) 1, 6, 12,
’decimam (Sibyllam) Tiburtem nomine Albuneam quae Tiburi colatur ut dea
iuxta ripas amnis Anienis, cuius in gurgite simulacrum eius inventum esse ,
