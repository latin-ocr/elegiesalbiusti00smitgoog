1,1,10] ¹, TIBVLLVS

10. musta: new wine, maestum, or oil, is still stored in these vals (lacus)
both in Italy and the East. A similar usage prevails in our cider mills of
the Northern States. The vintage mouth is October, ep. the Laus omnium
mensium 19 (PLM. IV, p. 291, Baehrens), ‘conterit October lascivis calcibus
uvas Ι et spumant pleno dulcia musta l'acu2' As the Italian October is mild,
Cato’s advice, De Agri Cult. 113, is good, ‘de lacu quarn primum vinum in
dolia indito.’ Other references to the vintage inTib. are 1, 5, 23 ς’ 1, 7, 35;
2,1,45; 2, 5, 853 see also Cato, De Agri Cale. 120; Verg. G. 2, 6; Colu-
mella, 12, 19.

11-12. The worship referred to was characteristic of all antiquity andis
often mentioned. Theophrastos says of the superstitious man (Charact. 28,
Jebb) that ‘he will pour oil from his flask on the smooth stones at the cross-
roads, as he goes by, and will fall on his knees and worship them before he
departs.’ Jebb quotes Lukian, Alexand. 303 Clemens Alex. Strom. 7, p. 302,
and Schulze cites Xen. Mem. 1, 1, 14. Cp. esp. Apuleius, Florida, 1,1,
‘ut ferme religiosis viantium moris est, cum aliqui lucus aut aliqui locus sanc-
tus in via oblatus est, votum postulare, pomum adponere, paulisper adsidere
. . . neque enim iustius religiosam moram viatori obiecerit aut ara floribus
redimita, aut spelunca floribus inumbrata, aut quercus cornibus onerata, aut
fagus pellibus coronata, vel enirn colliculus sepimine consecratus, vel truncus
dolamine effigiatus, vel caespes libamine fumigatus, vel lapis unguine delibu-
tus’3 Propert. 1, 4, 23-24; Ovid, Fast. 2, 641 (of the Termine).

11. nam: Tibullus never uses enim, cp. 1, 6, 21 n. 1

aa. Imitated in Carm. Epig. 1135, 6, ⁴ serta quod et tumulum florida saepe
ligant'; Mart. 8, 77, 4, ‘splendeat et cingant florea serta caput.'-in trivio
lapis: the persistence of the tradition is seen in the fact that in modern
Italy the same *spot'is often occupied by a way-side shrine. Indeed the reli-
gious associations of the cross-roads-especially in the worship of Hekate-
may still be traced in various superstitions of mediaeval and modern times,
cp. 1, 5, 54 and note. γ

13. educat: ‘bring tomaturity,¹ Catuli. 62, 41 ‘quem (rie. flos) mul·
cent aurae, firmat sol, educat imber,’ hence novus annus =‘the (current)
season.’ For this conception of annus as in itself the cause of the year’s
products, see 1, 4, 193 Livy, 4, 12, 7, ⁴ adversus annus frugibus’ ; Pervig. Ven.
51, ‘Hybla totos funde flores, quidquid annus adtulit’; Stat. Theb. 8, 301.

14. For the immernorial custom of first fruits‚ cp. eg. Pliny, HN. 18, 8,
‘ac ne degustabant quidem novas fruges aut vina, antequam sacerdotes primi·
tias libassent.’-agrlcolae deo: purposely indefinite, so 1, 5, 27; 2, 1, 36.
agricola as an adjective appears first in these three passages of Tib. and else·
where is found only in Propert. 2, 34, 74 3 Sidon. Epist. 4, 21, 6; Ovid. Mel.
