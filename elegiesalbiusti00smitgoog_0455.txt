, 2, 5, 19] TIBVLLVS

modern editors make Tibullus do the same. But the plain inserence of ‘nec
sore credebat,’ etc. (zi-22), following immediately upon ‘postquam . . . Lares’
(ιο-2ο) seems to be that the Sibyl gave her prophecy to Aeneas, not when he
reached Cumae at the end of his long journey, but just aiter he had escaped
from Troy and was preparing to, set out, asse. the Sibyl herself had not yet
gone on to Cumae. That this was what the poet had in mind is rendered
the more plausible by the fact that the Erythrae from which the Cumaean
Sibyl originally came was, according to a theory discussed in Tibullus's time
(Dionys. Hal. 1, 553 Pausan. ro, 12), located on Mt. Ida, in other words in
the very neighbourhood with which it is the constant tradition that Aeneas was
in some way associated during the very period suggested by 19-20, the inter·
val between his escape from Troy and his departure for Italy. Τίτε old ver·
sion was that the prophecy ,ιο Aeneas was given before his departure hythe
Sibyl of Marpessos. See Roscher's Lex„ av. ‘Sibylla’; Maass, Hermes, 18,
3273 and Robert, id. 22, 454; Leo, Phil. Umers. 2, 6.—ssrtes: aie. proph·
ecies in general, as in 69 and osten. So in the parallel passage os Vergil, A.
6, 71, Aeneas says to the Sibyl—

Te quoque magna manent regnis penetralia nostris:
hic ego namque tuas sortes arcanaque fata,

dicta meae genti, ponam lectosque sacrabo,

alma, viros,

referring of course to the Sibylline books (sortes), their preservation (pene-
tralia), and the care of them by the X Vviri (lectos viros).-postquam
dicitur sustinuisse: i.e. ‘postquam sustinuit, ut dicitur! The clause has
been incorporated with the verb of saying, cp. 1, 5, 93 2, 3, 29-30 and notes
-parontem . . Lares: these two details ot the Aeneas legend (Vergil, A. 1,
3783 2, 7073 4, 598, etc.) had been widely lrnown l'or many generations iu
both art and literature, eg. on numerous coins (the oldest os which isa coin
of Aeneia from the sixth century se), in the ‘Tabula iliaca’ which depicts the
legend as told by Stesichoros (630-550 ne), in his [liupersia in the lliuper·
sr's ol Arktinos‚ etc. A trag. of the [τοίνυν of Sophokles (344 N.), quoted
by Dionys. Hal. 1, 48, gives us the scene—

νΰν δ’ ἐν πύλαισιν Αἰνέας ὁτῆς θεοῦ
πάρεστ’ ἐπ’ ὤμων πατέρ’ ἔχων κεραυνίου
νώτου καταστάζοντα βύσσινον φάρος,
κύκλῳ δὲ πᾶσαν οίκετῶν παμπληθίαν·
συνοπάζεται δὲ πλῆθος οὐχ isenburch,
ol τῆσδ’ ἐρῶσι riis ἀποικίας Φρυγῶν.
