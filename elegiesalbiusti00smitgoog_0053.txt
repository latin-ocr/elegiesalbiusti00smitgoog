TIBVLLVS

old woman! I shall always love you, and for your sake, your
daughter. Whatever she does, she is still your blood. Teach her
to be true. Itoo promise to put up with the severest conditions!
Tben by way of a final parable to Delia the poet pictures the old
age of her who has been faithful to none.

Such is the brief outline of this famous love affair as related by
the poet himself. It will be seen that the poet's artistic reserve
and his deliberate programme of confining himself to the tra·
ditional motives of his department make it doubly difficult to de-
cide whether any given detail was drawn from his own experience
or from the literary record of his predecessors.

He tells us for example—and though he says itin an utterly con-
ventional manner we may well believe him - that Delia was beauti-
ful (1, 1, 55). But unlilre Propertius he does not revel in her
beauty‚ he does not enumerate her separate charms as a miser
counts his gold. He grants that she is endowed with ‘teneris
lacertis' (1, 5, 43). The adjective suggests the softness and
roundness of youth, and other pleasant but somewhat indefinite
· associations belonging to the arms of almost any agreeable girl by
whom one is loved. In the same passage he observes that she has

, golden hair—a suspicions detail in a land of brunettes‚ especially

in Delia's class, in which the peroxide blonde was very common.
She also reminds him of Thetis riding on the dolphin to her bride-
groom Peleus,·in other words, of a Hellenistic fresco the like of
which was to be seen, at that time, in the dwelliug of almost any
well-to-do householder in Italy.

Perhaps her bair was naturally golden, after all, and if we press
the comparison with Thetis, we may conclude that Delia bad the
blue eyes characteristic of all sea goddesses in good standing, and
that the bare extremities alluded to in 1, 3, 92, recalled to her
lover the ‘silverfoot' mother of Achilles

He also says that her hair was long (ι, 3, 91) - a not uncommon
distinction in one of her age and sex, but in her case inevitably
suggesting the old German proverb which declares that-
