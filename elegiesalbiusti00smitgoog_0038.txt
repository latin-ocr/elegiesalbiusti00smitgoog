INTRODUCTION

further down (line ιι) when Horace restates his previous assertion
as '-
et mundus victus non deficiente crumena,

he not only repeats with considerable accuracy the poet’s own
estimare, but even appears actually to have had the words in mind.
lt is probable that Tibullus was born on the ancestral estate.

Here (1, 10, 15-16) he passed his boyhood, and although like'
most other Romans of his position and circumstances he doubt-
less had a house in town and spent some portion of his time
there, the evidence of his surviving works as a whole (esp. r, 1 3
1, 5, ²⁰·343 2, 1; even a, 4, 53 ff.) clearly suggests so far as
it goes that during his entire career he was never absent ior any
extended period from his old horne. Now at the time Horace
wrote his epistle to Tibullus (possibly, 21-20 ne. -the date is un-
certain) our poet is described as sojourning ‘in regione Pedana)
Doubtless the old family place is referred to, and we are there-
fore safe in assuming that Tibullus was born there under the
shadow of the Sabine Hills not far from Pedum, 'an ancient Latin
town (Livy, 8, r 3) which once stood on the Via Labicana he·
tween Tibur and Praeneste. Porphyrio (note on Hor. l.c.) says
that in his tirne it had entirely disappeared: ‘Pedum oppidum
haud longe ab urbe fuit. Nunc nonest, verumadhuc regio ipsa
Pedana dicitur!

According to Baehrens’s brilliant but disputed emendation of
the corrupt opening sentence of the vita (see p. 173) Tibullus
was from Gabii. This famous old town which however, even in
Cicero’s time, had become the Sleepy Hollow of Latium,l stood
on the leit of the Via Praenestina near the modern Lago di Cas·
tiglione, about nine miles from Rome and only seven or eight from
Pedum. Hence the country seat to which Horace refers could
have been hardly more than a pleasant morning wall< from either

place. However that may be, it is worthy of note that Tibullus is
