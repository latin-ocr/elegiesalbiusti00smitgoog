to Pan (hence the modern name of ‘Pan's pipes ') and connected with the
story ol the nymph Syrinx, cp. Verg. E. 2, 323 Lucret. 4, 5883 Ovid, Met. 1,

33. Velabri: the flat marshy ground between the Capitoline, Palatine,
and Aventine hills somewhere between the Vicus Tuscus and the Forum
Boarium. 1t was often overflowed by the Tiber (Hor. od. 1, 2,13,etc.),
and, in fact, Varro, L. 1,. 5, 7, 43, derived the word from vehere, because it
was supposed that in early times transportation was as described here by
water, cp. Propert. 4, 2, 7, ‘hac quondam Tiberinus iter faciebat, et aiunt!
remorum auditos per vada pulsa sonos ’ς 4, 9, 5, ‘qua Velabra suo stagnabant
flumine quaque l nauta per urbanas velificabat aquas’; esp. Ovid, Fasti, 6,
405, ‘qua Velabra solent in Circum ducere pompas, Ι nil praeter salices cas·
saque canna t'uit. Ι saepe suburbanas rediens conviva per undas 1 cantat, et ad
nautas ebria verba iacit ’i etc.

primitive type oi boat. The word is masculine here and also in Velleius, 2,

'39-64. The poet bad apparently lost himself sor the moment in his idyllic
picture of other days. He is suddenly awakened by the prophecy of the
Sibyl (postponed since 19). For this characteristic device cp. 1, 4, 81—84;
2, 4, 51-52 and notes. The abrupt beginning of the Sibyl’s prophecy is

entirely in keeping with her condition when inspired by the god, cp. 65 and
6611. For the sudden change of speakers cp. Propert 4, 1, 71, audior
similar prophecies, Verg. A. 6, 85ι; Propert. 4,1, 53; Ovid, Met. 15, 439;
