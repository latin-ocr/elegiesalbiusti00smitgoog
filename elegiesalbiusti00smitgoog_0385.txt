1, ro,18] TIBVLLVS

with de, 1, 1,4ο; 2,1, 59. ex is used of the whole, 2, 6, 54, and of origin,
1, 2, 4ο, otherwise local.

18. veteris avl; cp. antiquo avo, 1, 1, 42. Tibullus’s fondness for vetus,
⁵ antiquus, priscus, and synonyms bas often been observed.

20. exigua aede: the ararium-deuse 1, 6, 43 n.; 2, 5, 30, etc.

21-24. 1,1,20; 1, 3,342nd notes.

21. placatus erat: imperfect, r'.e. placatio is an adjective, not a participle.

22. Martial, 7, 63, 4, ‘credis et Aoniae Bacchica serta eomae,’ also Ovid,
Amor. 3, 10, 363 Fasti, 4, 616 are quoted here as imitatione, cp. also 1, 3, 66.

23-24. Ovid, Fasti, 2, 652, ‘stat puer et manibus lata canistra tenet, Ι inde
ubl ter fruges medios immisit in ignis, Ι porrigit incisos tilia parva savoe’

23. atque: connects with the previous sentence, que the two parts of the
sentence introduced by atque. So‘atque . . . 01,’2,1,65; 2, 2, 8; 2, 4,
47, ‘et . . . que,’ 1, 9, 48, etc. Doubled atque is found only in 2, 5, 73.-
liba: 1, 7, 5411.

25. Voss sees in aerata here 2 reference to the bronze weapons of the
Celts of Aquitania. lf so, the coming campaign referred to here would be the
one which the poet afterwards described in 1, 7, 3 f. See below.÷nobis: for
the dative‚4,4, 1 n. '

2⁶. The line is vary troublesome as it stands. Some, eg. Ramsay, (cp.
also, Korn, Rhein. Mus. 2ο, 168; wilhelm, jahrb. Phil. 1895, p. 125) con·
strue hostia, etc, witlr Lares as a second subject of depellite (ie. both the Lares
and the pig offered to them are asked to protect the worshipper). Others,
eg. Schulze, supply an erit vobis with hostia and make que = ‘and then’ (as
in Ovid, Amor. 3, 13, 16; Met. 10, 252), ie. depellite, etc. :the protasis and
hostia (erievobis), etc. = the apodosis of a conditional sentence. 'l'he impera-
tive as 2 protasis is not uncommon, but 1 find 110 parallel 101 the combination
of such 2 protasis with an spodosis consisting 01 2 mere nominative and modi-
fiers hanging in mid-air. lt seems far better therefore to follow the Itali
and such modern editors as Baehrens and Postgate in indicating 2 lacuna
between 25 and 26. aerata tela plainly indicates‘ barbarous weapons,’
as Postgate remarks, but the reference is not clear enough as it stands. We
need, and Tibullus would naturally write, a pentameter giving the epithet
more definite form and perhaps even adding some detail sufficient to identify
the particular enemy referred to. 26 is best explained as the end of 2 sen·
tence (describing some detail of sacrifice to the Lares) the beginning of which
has been lost. If so at least two lines have dropped out, the original pen-
tameter with 25, and the original hexameter with 26.

On the offering of a pig to the lares (a favourite victim with the Romans)
cp. Plautus, Ruri. 1208; Hor. od. 3,17, 15 ; 23, 4; Sat. 2, 3,165; etc.
