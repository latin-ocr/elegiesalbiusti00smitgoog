December). Both here and certainly in Stat. Lc. it is fair to presume that
the epithetis agenuine echo of Tibullus. And the same is certainly true of a
passage from the Humanists just given me by Professor Mustard. In an
epigram on the Aqua Paula at Rome Girolamo Alcandro (1480-1542) says—

uullus ubi e caelo progignit Iuppiter imbres,
effusis agros Nilus inundat aquis.

nullus ubi Nilus stagnanti exuberat amne,
demittunt pluvium nubila densa Iovem.

neutrum Roma petit, munus namque implet utrumque
nomine quae lympha est, Paule, superba tuo.

These five examples of the phrase arethe only ones 1 arn able to quote from
Latin either ancient or modern. One would naturally expect to find along
tradition for the phrase ‘Jupiter Pluvius’ in our own language in view of the
fact that, certainly in this country if not in England, it is a Latin tag so familiar
that newspaper men often use it to adorn their account of the latest rain·
storm. But this does not appear to have been the case. Sir Richard Burton’s

‘Pluvian Jove’ (see Murray’s New English Dict. sv. ‘Pluvian’) is an un·
doubted echo of it. But this was as late as 1851, and the use of the Latin
phrase itself by an English writer is not cited for any one before George
Augustus Sala in 1862. As Sala was a newspaper man, this might'account
for the frequeucy of the expression in the English newspapers to·day;
but it is as little likely that he is responsible for the widespread familiarity
with the phrase as that he himself derived it from any of the classical ex·
amples cited. Iu Germany, however, the situation is far clearer. There
too 'Jupiter Pluvius’ is a household word, but there the use of it undoubtedly
goes baclr, as Bilchmann has observed in his Geflrtgelte Worte, to Goethe.
Goethe, a deep student of the Roman elegy, uses the expression twice, first, in
the Wunderers Sturmlr'ed (1772) and long afterward in Epigram 22 (1790).

lt seems lilrely, therefore, that it was really Goethe who has transmitted to us ¹

the only Tibullian phrase to be found in the ordinary speech of modern times.

Iuppiter pluvias is probably a translation of Ζεὺς Ὑέτιος (first in Aristot. De
Mundo, 7). As Morgan observes, the designation of Jupiter here is literal.
Other epithets of Jupiter in this function are eg. Imbricr'tor (Ennius, Ann.
444, V.; Apuleius, De Mundo, 37 ; Macrob. 1, 17, 49; etc.); Pluvia(lis)
(CIL. 9, 234), etc. On Jupiter in this rhle see M. H. Murgan, ‘Rain Gods
aud Rain Charms,’ Proceed. Am. Phil. Arroc. XXXII, 83-109.

For the statement that the Nile talres the place of rain in Egypt see eg.
Apoll. Rhod. 4, 269 ; Cicero, N. D. 2, 130 ; Ovid, Ars Amat. 1, 647; Lucan,
8, 4443 Val. Flacc. 5, 423 ; etc.
