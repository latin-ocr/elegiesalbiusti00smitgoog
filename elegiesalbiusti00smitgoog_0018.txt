INTRODUCTION

Ῑ. DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELEGY

Tris Roman elegy founded by Cornelius Gallus and perfected
by Tibullus, Propertius, and Ovid was the culmination of an
aesthetic evolution the earliest stage of which in our surviving
record carries us as far back as the days when the kingdom of
Gyges and Kroisos still loomed large on the eastern horizon of
Hellenic civilization.1 Nor ean it be claimed that even then
the elegy was in any respect rudimentary. On the contrary the
great typical moods of the department are all visible and the
elegiae distieh² shows by its very perfection of technique that it ,
had already been subJected to artistic manipulation for a consider-
able length of time.

Itis impossible here to diseuss the question of origins⁸ at any
length. The matter was obscure even to the ancient crities‚ and
the solutions offered by modern scholarship are none of them en-
tirely satisfactory. It is important however to observe that the
traditional association of the elegy with the flute naturally points to
an ultimate origin in the sphere of those orgiastic eults with which
the flute itself was identified.⁴ The real significanee of this state·
ment becomes evident as soon as we recall to mind that in a

1'1’he only satisfactory account of the elegy as a whole is given by Crusius, , ,

ferred to it for further details and for the most important literature of the subject.
