toris, feminum, capitis percussiones,' but it was not at all uncommon, cp.
Augustus himself after the defeat of Varus, Sueton. Aug. 23,‘a‹leo denique
consternatum ferunt, ut per continuos menses barba capilloque summisso
caput interdum foribus illideret vociferans “Quintili Vare, legiones redde.”’
The best description of this orgiastie stage of mourning is perhaps Lukian,
De Luctu, 12, οἰμωγαὶ ἐπὶ τούτοις καὶ κωκυτὸς γυναικῶνκαὶ παρό πάντων
δάκρυα καὶ στέρνα τυπτόμενα καὶ σπαραττομένη κόμη καὶ φοινισσόμεναι παρειαί·
καί που καὶ ἐσθὴς καταρρήγνυται καὶ κόνις ἐπὶ τῇ κεφαλῇ τάττεται καὶ ol ζῶντες
οἰκτρότεροι τοῦ νεκροῦ· of μὲν ’γὰρ χαμαὶ κυλινδοῦνται πολλάκις καὶ τός κεφαλὰς
όρόττουσι πρός τό ἔδαφος, ό δὲ εὐσχήμων καὶ καλός καὶ roff ὑπερβολὴν ἐστεφα·
νωμένος όφηλόι πρόκειται καὶ μετέωρος ὥσπερ ἐι πομπὴν κεκοσμημένοι.

87-88. Here the poet turns suddenly on some unfeeling scoller in his

- audience (laetus, ‘he jests at scats that never felt a wound ’) and takes refuge
in the universal folk doctrine of Nemesis or balance reflected in numerous
popular sayings, ⁸ 'Tis a long laneythat has no turning,' ‘Pride goeth before a
fall,' etc„ and appearlng again and again in antique authors, cp. 1, 5, 5-6 n.;
1, 5, 69-70 n.; Soph. Elektra, 915, ἀλλ’ ό φίλη, θάρσυνε· τοῖς αὐτοῖσί τοι Ι
οὐχ αὐτὸς αἰεὶ δαιμόνων παραστατεῖ, etc., cp. 2, 6, 19-20 n.

87. at: 1, 1, 33 n.-caveto: soliman, 1, 5,69; esto, 1, 8, 503 servato and
caveto, 1, 6, 16 f.; caveto, 4, 2, 3, saneto, 4, 5, 9. The second imperative
outside ol certain verbs is more or less old-fashioned and solemn, and is there·
fore not infrequent in the poets. Sometimes the distinction can be felt but not
always ; eg. faveto, 4, 5, 9, is immediately preceded by cape.

88. uni: for the (rare and poetic) dative with saevire cp. Ovid‚ Her.4, 148
and 83 n. on templis-usque: rie. semper. This use of usque as an inde·
pendent adverb is characteristic of the follr speech (hence abundant in
Plautus and Terence) and of the poets, esp. of the elegy and of Martial;
every one remembers Catullus’s ‘Egnatius qui candidos habet dentes Ι renidet
usque quaque' The use of usque thus in Livy is a mark of his poetical style.
Elsewhere in classical prose it is very rare, and only in certain phrases like
usque adeo, dune, donec, etc. ln the elegiae poets this use of usque is especially
common in the pentameter, and in over 80), of the cases it begins the last
dactylas here. Eleven, for example, are found in Tibullus (8 of them in the
pentameter), and all in the last dactyl (1, 2, 88; 3, 163 5, 74; 6, 8; 8, 36; 9,
38; 2, 4, 143 2, 5, 32). Hence the tendency of certain cadeuces to become
fixed,e.g. usque ntoras, 1, 3, 16; Ovid‚ Fast. 3, 686; usquesores, 1, 5, 74; Ovid‚
Amor. 1, 4, 62, usque manu, 2, 4, 145 Ovid‚ Fast. 3, 872; Ibis, 424, etc.

ln the hexameter the usual position of usque (though never so in Tibullus,
cp. 2, 5, 63 and ¹¹¹3 2, 6, 35) is at the beginning of the fifth foot.

89-96. The application of this law of Nemesis to love runs all through
