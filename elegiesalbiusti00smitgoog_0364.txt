you swore to be true with oaths strong enough to make me believe there
were no stars in heaven and no glow in lightning. Nay, you even wept, and
l, guileless that 1 was and all too ready to believe, wiped your tears away.
What can I do-if you were not in love with a girl-but may she he as
fickle as you have been! How often, hoping you would appreciate it, I have
helped you to meet her! I should have known better. Nay, 1 even sang your
praises. NowIamashamed ofmysell and os my verses. Would they were

surpass your sister, that ribald votary ol both Bacchos and Venus, your sister,
whom, they say, the star of morning sees still at her cups. Really, however,
your wit'e has nothing left to learn -though you are too stupid to read the
signs Do you imagine her daily attention to her hair, her jewellery, her cos-
tumes for the street, aud all that, is on your account? Not, however, that any

‘Yet this is the man on whom my boy has bestowed himself. You sbame to
yoursels and me, disgraced, degraded, lorswornl You will weep when you
see another in your place. But your pain shall he my pleasure, and a golden
palm dedicated to Venus and inscribed with my story shall record my gratitudo
lor having escaped the slavery os a lying love!
