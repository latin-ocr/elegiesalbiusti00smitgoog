NOTES [a 6, 23

19-20. ‘Hope springs eternal in the human breast: Ι Man never is, but
always to be blest ’3 Apollodoros, 9 K., οὐδέποτ’ ἀθυμεῖν τὸν κακῶς πράττοντα

δεΐ,Ι ἄνδρες, τὸ, βελτίω δὲ προσδοκᾶν ἀεί· cp. Soph. 862 N.; Menander,
Mon. 643 M.. etc. For characteristic rhetorical amplifications see Ovid above
and Anah. Lat. 415, 1 t'. R.

The choice of the homely old proverb, 'cras erit melius,' to express the
thought is esp. artistic, cp. the shepherd Corydon in Theokrit. 4, 41, θαρσεῖν
χρή, φίλε Βάττε· τάχ’ αὔριον ἔσσετ’ ἄμεινον. Ι ἐλπίδες έν ζωοῖσιν, ἀνέλπιστοι
δὲ θανόντες, etc. No other caseos the proverb in this form is quoted from
Latin, cp. however, Petron. 45, ‘qubd hodie non est cras erit! ‚

Carm. Epig. 949 B. is quoted as a possible echo ol Tib. ‘si potes, et non
vis, cur gaudia differs Ι spemque loves et cras usque redire iubesr’ etc.

πι-σσ. On the imagery, 1, 7, 31 n.; 2, 3, 62; Ovid, Rem. Amor. 173; and
often. For the farmer as an illustration ol hope cp. Anah. Lat. 415, 51, ‘sperat
qui curvo sulcos perrumpit aratro, 1 sperat qui ventis vela ferenda dedit, l . . .
spes sequitur gravibus rastris mala rura domantem, l in nova se nulla cum
ratione parat'; Menander, 641 K.,a τῶν γεωργῶν ἡδονὴν ἔχει βίος, Ι ταῖς
ἐλπίσιν τᾰλγεινὰ παραμυθούμενος· Philem. 82 K, aet ’γεωργὸς είς νέωτα
πλούσιος. Mustard notes Andrea Navagero, Vola Cereri pro terrae fru-

‘bus-

gy ¹ sed quae credidimus bene cultis semina campis
uberius largo faenore reddat ager.

Gio. Francesco Loredano, Biaaarrr'e Academicke, Venice, 1642, p. 217 ff.
quotes these lines of Tibullus, as well as many other passages from ancient
and modern authors, in his long chapter, Della Speranza.

23-24. Sometimes the hunted are described so to spealt as ¹ Prisoners of
Hope,’ cp. eg. Seneca, Epist. 8, 3, ‘ad omne fortuitum bonum suspiciosi
pavidique subsistite: et fera et piscis spe aliqua oblectante decipitur.'

Writers of dactylic verse generally mention sowling and iishing together as
here and in much the same words, cp. ovid, Her. 19, 133 Rem. Amor. 207;
Mer. 8, 855; 15, 4733 etc.

The snaring of small birds for food is still to be seen all over Italy, and
nowadays seems to be esp. characteristic of that country.

23· captat: not ‘catch' or 'taire’ but ‘seek to catch‚’ i.e. it is hope
(haec) that prompta men to hunt and fish, ep. Anah. lat. 415, 53 R., ‘spes
hamis pisces, laqueo captare volucres Ι erudit? lndeed the hopelulness 01' the
fisherman under difficulties has long been proverbial, cp. Plautus Rud. 310
(Trachalio to the fishermen), ‘salvete, fures maritumi, conchitae atque hamio-
tae, Ι famelica hominum natio. quid agitis? ut peritis?' To which the reply
is, ‘ut piscatorem aequumst, fame sitique speque falsa!
