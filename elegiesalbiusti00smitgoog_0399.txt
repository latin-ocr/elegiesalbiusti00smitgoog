2,1,2] ' ’ Travuuvs

voeibus,” hoc est bona omina habete aut tacete'3 Macrob. 1, 16, 3, ‘cum
hostia caeditur, fari nefas est, inter caesa et porrecta fari licet, rursus, cum
adoletur, non licet! The phrase frequently occurs, cp. 2, 2, 1-2 ; Hor. oa
3, 1, 2; Ovid, Ars Anaat. 1, 268 ; Cicero, Div. 2, 40, 83, and often. The
corresponding phrase used by the Greeks for the same purpose was εὐφημεῖτε,
cp. cg. Iliad, 9, 171 ; Eurip. Bacch. 701 Aristoph. Thesm. 39; etc.

a. prisco avor see 1,1, 42 n. and cp. 1,10,18. Usually explained as l
‘ancestoa’ So occasionally in the poets (the Thes. cites Vergil, A. 7, 22ο; 3
12, 164; Val. Flacc. 6, 518, al. ‚¹ Propert. 2, 34, 56). The plural in this sense }

(also poetical) is much more common.
3. cornibus: symbolizing fertility and masculine strength. Hence, the

river gods are frequently represented with the borns of a bullock. The horus 2
of Bacchos appear to have been given him in the Alexandrian Age and heis 2
frequently thus represented on the coins of the Diadochi. Plutarch, De Is. ³
ct Orir. 35 (Mor. 364 F) says that in his time this conception of Dionysos ᾗ
was common in Greek art, cp. also Philost. Imag. 1, 15, etc. Among the l

occasional references in the Roman poets may be mentioned Hor. od. 2, 19,
30 ; Ovid, Met. 4, 193 Propert. 3,17, ¹93 Stat. Sila. 3, 3, 62 ; etc.

4. spicis: Ovid, Amor. 3. ιο, 33 Tib. 1, 1, 16, and often. Offerings
to the gods (cp. uva) are regularly suggestive of their attributes or of the
worshipper's wants at the time.

5-12. Imitated by Sannazaro, Arcadia, p. 35, ed. Scherillo (Milan, 1888).

5-10. The injunction that all work shall cease upon a holy day was a nota·
ble article, as Plutarch observed (Quaeri. Rom. 25), of the old Roman religion.
It was felt that the day belonged to the god 2ηά to his service. Another reason
-and this is characteristically pagan-was that if the officiating priest hap-
pened to see any one at work upon that day be became ceremonially uncleau,
and therefore the sacrifice lost its virtue, cp. Servius on Verg. G. 1, 268,
‘sunt enim aliqua quaesi festis diebus fiant ferias polluant: qua propter
et pontifices sacrificaturi praemittere calatores suos solent (see dict. av.
‘praecia’ and ‘praeciamitator’) ut, sicubi viderint opifices adsidentes opus
suum, prohibeant ne pro negotio suo et ipsorum oculos et caerimonias deum
attaminent: feriae enim operae deorum creditae sunt (cp. Tib. 9). sane feriis
terram ferro tangi nefas est, quia feriae deorum causa instituuntur) Theo·
logical discussion-of which considerable survives-was mainly concerned,
as in the case of the Jewish sabbath, with just what might or might not
be done, cp. eg. Cato, 2,4 and 1383 Verg. G. 1, 268; esp. Macrob. 1,
16, 10, who among other things quotes the opinion of Scaevola that ‘si bos
in specum decidisset eumque paterfamilias adhibitis operis liberasset, non est
visus ferias polluisse’ -an interesting prototype of Maltino, 12, 11 ; Lake, 14, 5.
