NOTES 1 [2, 1, 47

38. querna glande: refers to the widespread tradition in antiqnity that
acorns formed the staple iood οἰ primaeval man, cp. 2, 3, 69 and eg. Ovid,
Amor. 3, 10, 9; Fasti, 1, 676; 4, 3993 Verg. G. 1, 8 and 1593 Pliny, 16, 13 etc,
etc. desuevit, etc, is therefore tantamount to stating that t'he invention ol
agriculture was due to the rural gods, cp. Juvenal’s method of stating the
same thought (14, 181), ‘panem quaeramus aratro, Ι qui satis est mensis:
laudant hoc numina ruris, Ι quorum ope et auxilio gratae post munus aristae Ι
contingunt homini veteris fastidia quercus.

39-40. The negative desuevit, etc, in lieu oi the positive, ‘agriculture was
discovered' (37-38), is followed (39-40) by the reverse arrangement, ae. the
positive, ‘men lived in houses’ in lieu of tbe negative, ‘men ceased to live in
caves,’ etc. On the theory oi primaeval men as cave dwellers, cp. eg. Lu-
cret. 5, 956 and 1012; Ovid, Met. 1, 121; Juv. 6, 1, l.; etc. On the develop-
ment of domestic architecture see eg. Vitruv. 2, 1. The ancient thinlrers bad
a strong tendency to attach all inventions to some definite name. Here eg.
Pliny repens, 7, 194, that ‘laterarias ac domos constituerunt primi Euryalus ¹
et Hyperbius fratres Athenis. . . . tegulas invenit Cinyra Agriopae filius) For
atria as a theme of elegy see Introd. p. 19

41. 1, 3, 41 n.; Pan. Messal. 4, 1,171;, Aisch. Prom. 462.

42. Α homely detail, but marking one of the most important epoche in the
history of civilization. I find no mention of it elsewhere. For the phrasing

cp. Vergil, A. 2, 235, ‘accingunt ornnes operi pedibusque rotarum Ι subiciunt
lapsus,' etc. The invention of four-wheeled vehicles was ascribed to the 1
Phrygiam, Pliny, 7, 199, etc.

. 1, , n.
ii. nnliqirle methods of irrigation are described by Vergil, G. 1, 106 f.

It was common in Homer's time, cp. Iliad, 21, 257 i-irriguas: active. So
eg. Verg. G. 4, 32, cp. 25 11. above.

45-46. 1, 5, 23-24 n.

45. aurea uva: the epithet suggests that the poet’svineyards· yielded a
variety oi white wine like those which are still to be had in the immediate
neighbourhood, otherwise aurea must be taken as in 1, 6, 58, where see n.

4⁶. securo: active (cp. irrr'guas, 44 above), as in Verg. A. 6, 715, which
refers to tbe river ol Lethe, cp. Plato’s name lor Lethe (Rep. 10, 621 A)
τὸν Ἀμέλητα ποταμόν, where the adjective is used in the same way. see
also Ovid,Pont. 2, 4, 23, ‘securae pocula LethesJ—sobria: 1, 6, 28 n. Vergil,
G. 1, 9, also refers to this discovery as a stage in the evolution of civilization.
Pliny, 7, 199, says that this invention is attributed to Staphylus, the son oi
Silenus.
