the antique point of view the rainbow here expresses best the idea desired,
i.e. the imminence of a violent thunderstorm. imbrifer asan epithet of the
rainhow is not uncommon (e. g. Seneca, Oed. 315 ; Stat. Theb. 9, 4053 Silv.
3, 3, 81). The difficulty with it here (irrespective of the fact that it practically
repeats the idea of ‘venturam aquam ') is that it necessitates arbitrary length·
ening oi the final syllable of the preceding verb, which, though occasional at
the end of the first hemistich of the pentameter, ought not to be found in
Tibullus. nimbiser does not happen to occur as an epithet of arcus, but it
is near imbrifer and it expresses an association with the rainbow which is
familiar to antiquity. picta is also occasionally used to describe the colours
of the rainbow. lf we retain it here, ferrugine portrays the colours of the
rainbow and is used like its close congener purpureus, πορφύρεος (Propert. 3,
5, 32; Homer, Il. 17, 547) in the same connection. We should then talre
praetexens more in its original sense and the idea would be something lilre
‘limning on the skies her (awesome) pageantry oi colours! Note that the
metaphor which suggested the designation ‘rainhow,’ ‘arcus’ and which is so
familiar to Rome and the modern world, was to the Greeks not only foreign
but repugnant. Aischrion’s line, lym δ’ ἔλαμψε, καλὸν οὐρανοῦ τόξον, seems to
be the one surviving example (in the LXX, Genesis, 9, 14, etc, τὸ τόξον ἐν τῇ
νεφέλῃ is merely a translation from Hebrew) and this was quoted by the
rhetoricians as a glaring instance of bad taste, cp. Rhetores Oraeci, 3, p. 650
Walz.

44. remittat: acceleret, ‘drives on at full s'peed,’ esp. of horsea, cp.
dictt. and Dirae, 38, ⁸ Eurus agat mixtam fulva caligine nubem.’—nimbifer
Eurus: the adjective is rare but fitting. Eurus is eminently a storm wind, cp.
such epitheta for him in the poets as nubifer, aquosus, atrox, insanus, niger,
saevus, stridens, etc.

45. puppi: a rowboat of course is meant.

48. hauctus: the absolute use as here is not common, cp. Stat. Theb.
11, 94.-atteruisse: the only surviving ex. of this old perf. of attero (ie.
terui instead of the later trivi, ie. teri'vi) outside of Apuleius and the Itala.
