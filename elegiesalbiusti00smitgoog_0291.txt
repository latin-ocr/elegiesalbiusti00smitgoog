privatione not so common now. odysseus himself assures Eumaios (15, 343)
that πλαγκτοσύνης δ’ οὐκ ἔστι κακώτερον ἄλλο βροτοῖσιν. It is therefore a
favourite curse, eg. Ovid, Her. 6, 161, ‘cum mare cum terras consumpserit,
aera temptet: Ι erret inops, exspes, caede cruenta sua ’; Ibis, 113, ‘exul inops
erres, alienaque limina lustres, Ι exiguumque petas ore tremente eibum?
Most interesting here is the new fragment of Archilochus (l) which appears
to have been the model of Horace, Epoal 10. Isubjoin the text as given in
Diehl’s Supplementum Lyricum, 2d edit. Bonn, 1910, p. 1) —

κύματι τλα[ζύμ]ενο[1

κάν Σαλμνδ[ηοσ]ᾥ γυμνὸν εὐφρονέστατα
θμήϊκες ἁκρ6[κ]ομοι

λιίβοιεν (ἔνθα πόλλ’ ἀναπλήσει κακά,
δούλιον ίμτον ἔδων).

ῥίγει τετηγ6τ’ αι’ντόν, ἐκ δὲ τοῦ [ῥό]θου

φυκία πόλλ’ ίτ[έ] χοι,

αροτίοι δ’ ὀδόντας, ὡς [κύ]ον etl στόμα
κείμενος ἀκροτίῃ

Εκρον ταρὰ ῥηγμῖνα ευμίτω[ν ὀ]μοῦ ·
ταῦτ’ ἐθέλοιιί ἂν ίόεΐν,

70. villa: ie. treated as such by him, so Ovid, Fasti, 4, 2443 Ibis, 4543
etc.
71-72. The topic is traditional, cp. eg. Ovid, Ars Amat. 1, 659-6633

, Propert.1,12,16; 4, 5, 21-6o; Ovid, Amor. 1, 8, 23-1083 Publii. Syr. 563

Lukian, 7'0x.13; etc.

71. ipsa: ie. if love is merely a matter of money what Venus herself
desiresis no longer possible. There is no place for it. This ends the in-
structions of Priapos. They are fairly summed up iu Propert. 1, 1, 15, ‘ergo
velocem potuit domuisse puellam: Ι tantum in amore preces et benefacta
valent!

73-74. Titio: the identityof this man and the reason for his presence here
have been much discussed. One important reason for his appearance is to
form a transition to 3 topics traditionally associated with this theme, viz. the
situation iu 74, the magister amoris, 77-80, and physician, heul thyself, 81-84.
Otherwise the elegy would not only end tamely at 72 but it would also he
incomplete. Another and in itself asufficient reason for Titius here was as
we shall see to mislead the reader for the time being. The theory that
Titius: ‘John Doe ’ or ‘Richard Roe,’ ie. the poet’s imaginary ‘friend’ 111
