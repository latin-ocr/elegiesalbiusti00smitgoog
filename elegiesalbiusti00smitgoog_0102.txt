The second is the law oi department. The distich requires to
be handled with the utmost daintiness and skill. It is less toler-
ant of exceptional usage in the elegy than in the epigram. The

hexameter os the elegy for example is ostensibly the same as that ’

os the epigram, the epic, 3ηά the Horatian satire. But in freedom
os usage by departments there is a regular decrease in the order
— satire, epic, epigram, elegy. Hence the difference between the
hexameter of Ovid the elegiae, and Ovid the epic poet.

To the combined operation of both laws, the law ol chronology
and the law oi department, is due the apparent contradiction that
the hexameter of Horace the satirist is nearer to the verse osv
Lucretius the epic poet than to the verse oi Juvenal in his own
department, and that the distich ol Martial the epigrammatist par·¹
takes less oi his predecessor Catullus than of Ovid the elegist.
The multiplied pressure of both laws iu the elegy itsels greatly
accelerated the growth of the distich. Less than ageneration
completeda process which in the case of the epic went ou lor
more than a century.

The main points to be considered in the hexameter are the
caesura, the cadence, the schemata, and the proportion oi dac-
tyls. The details os Tibulliau usage in these respects are meu·
tioned in the commentary as they occurs Here it is enough to
say that Tibullus’s fondness sor the favourite Roman caesura semi·
quinaria (as, e.g.,in 1, 1, 1) is less marked than that os Ovid.
His proportion os dactyls is also somewhat less and the slight in-
crease in his dactyls from 44.9per cent in book 1 to 48.6per cent
in book a seems to indicate that in this respect he was developingiu
the directionot Ovid. The versus spondiacus however(i.e.aspondee
in the fifth soot) is never found. Ten occur in the elegy ol Ca·
tullus,6 iu the elegy os Ovid, 7 in Propertius. In his cadence too
Tibullus is more careful even than Ovid. Propertius on the con·
trary, especially in ¹his earlier work, drops back almost to the in·
experience oi Catullus.
