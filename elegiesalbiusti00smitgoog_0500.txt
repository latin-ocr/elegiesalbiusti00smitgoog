NOTES [4‚4

15-16. 2, 3, 71-72. The motive is traditional, cp. Phaidra in Eurip. Hippol.
208, nl, el, Ι πῶς ἂν δροσερᾶς ἀπὸ ,κρηνῖδος Ι καθαρῶν ὑδάτων πῶμ’ ἀρυσαὶμιιν, Ι
ὑπό τ’ αἱγείροις ἕν τε κομὴτῃ Ι λειμῶνι κλιθεῖσ’ deuteresim· Ovid, Her. 4,
44; 513, Met. ιο, 555, etc.

The sentence isan ideal'condition, ‘the forest would please me is,' etc.
The point οἱ view reflects her own words, 4, 7, 9, where see note.

15. lux mea: used once by Sulpicia herself (4, 12, 1), but does not occur
elsewhere in the Tibullian corpus. Perhaps the use os it in a poem written in
her 1111111 was meant to be reminiscent of her style. Tibullus himself never
uses pet names at a11; indeed, except in 2, 5, 114, and 2, 6, 28, Nemesis is not
even addressed directly (cp. 1, 6, 21 11.). The comparative frequency οἱ
these expressions in Propertius is characteristic and possibly temperameptal,
cp.luxmea,2, 14, 29; 28, 59; 29, 1, vitq, 1, 2, 1; 8, 2²5 2, 5,18; 19, 27³
2o,17; 24, 29; 3o,14; meavita, 2, 3, 23; 2ο, 11; 26,1. Ovid uses mea

maestissima dixit Ι “lux mea ’' quaeque solent verba iuvare viros?’; Ι Trist.
3, 3, 52; mea vito, Amor. 2, 15, 21. The frequency and variety of such
epithets in any given department vary inversely with the distance os it from
the language and style of ordinary life.

17-18. That is, Sulpicia hopes that in his love sor her Cerinthus will give
up the original object os bis expedition altogether. All for love, so to speak,
and the boar well lost.

17. abibit: sor the shift from the subjunctive see 1, 1, 24 n. To the girl’s
lively fancy the situation pictured iu 15-16 has become real.

19. 11111 me sit nulla Venus: quoted by Moore 1'or his song, ‘Sympathy.'

22. diripienda: 1, 2, 70 n.

23. parenti: it is impossible to guess who is meant, cp. Introd. p. 86.
Probably however parenti = patri.

24. Propert. 3, 20, 10, ‘fidus ero: in nostros curre, puella, toros!

A poem on an illness os Sulpicia, perhaps the same illness to which she her·
aelf refers in 4, 11. On this conventional theme of the elegy see 1, 5, 9-19 n.
Apollo is addressed, of course, ns the god of healing.

‘A lovely girl is ill. Come hither, Apollo, we beseecb thee, make haste
with thy remedies, lay thy healing hands upon her, and make her well again.
Do not torture her lover. He is distraught with anxiety and is making vows
innumerable.

‘Conrage, Cerinthus, the gods have lovers in their keeping. Just go on
