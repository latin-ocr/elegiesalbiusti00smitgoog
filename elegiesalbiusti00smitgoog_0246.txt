gerously ill. Love, then, was the real omen which both should have observed
and obeyed. Therefore, ‘audeat invito ne quis,’ etc. Another characteristic
illustration of the power of love, cp. 1, 2, 89-96, 1, 5, 1-6, and 1, 6, 29-30,
with notes.

23-24. The poet calls upon Isis for help, although, in spite of her obliga·
tions to Delia (23-26), he certainly has received none so far. If, however,
she will help —and her ability to help is well attested-Delia will do further
service. The natve combination of doubt and fervent prayer accompanied by
flattery and ending with a bribe is characteristic.

The worship of Isis began to assume prominenee in Rome as early as the
time of Sulla, and in spite of occasional opposition from the state continued to
thrive and spread until, by the third century Α.ι)., it had penetrated to all
parts of the empire. In the time of Augustus it was especially popular with
women of Delia’s elass (hence tua, 23), which accounts for the frequent ref-
erence to it in the elegiae poets. A century later the worship was recruited
from all ranks, and for many generations it was a most formidable rival of
Christianity. In fact, it has often been observed that in its ideas and symbols, its
aseetic regulations (ep. 1, 2, 85-86 n.) and ritual, it has much in common with
Christianity. The worship involved a complicated ritual, all sorts of symbolic
observances, tasting, mortification of the flesh, etc. (cp. 25 below). Through ¹
strict observance of these the neophyte might rise to a better knowledge of
the secrets of the goddess. In return she promised her protection in this
world and a life of service in the world'to come.

There was a regular morning and evening service (cp. 31) and also certain
yearly festivals, esp. the Isidis Navigium, which began March 5, and about
Nov.,1 a great festival, during which was enacted the well-known story of the
goddess-ending with εὑρήκαμεν, συγχαίρομεν, ete. (Schol. on Juv. 8, 293
Sen. Apocol. 13, ete), the cry of joy given by the worshippers at the dis·
covery of the lost Sarapis-Osiris (Minue. Fel. 22, 1, etc.). .

²4· aera: i.e. theristrum or rattle which from time immemorial was asso·
eiated with the cult of Isis. The use of it was in itself an act of worship and
devotees regularly employed it (as here) during the long hours of prayer and
meditation in the temple, which was so characteristic of the worship of this
goddess that Florus, in the seeond century, speaks (p. 185, Rossb.) of taking
a journey to Egypt, ‘ut ora Nili rdderem et populum semper in templis otiosum

peregrinae deae sistra pulsantem! Such hours were in addition to the regular
services and were, of course, undertaken for some special purpose. Here
Delia is supposed to have been praying for her lover, cp. Ovid, Amor. 3, 9, 33
(on the death of Tin), ‘quid vos saera iuvant, quid nune Aegyptia prosunt l
sistra, quid in vacuo secubuisse toro? ’
