suos tibi contribuit! The thought is not as common in modern literature.
Note however Shak. Henry VI, Paris, Act 2, Sc. 5 (Richard to Mortimer)-

Ο uncle, would some part of my young years
Might bnt redeam the passage of your agel

⁶3· mint: for the ethical dative see 2, 2, ¹33 2, 4, 2.-tecnrn contribuisse:
i.e. ‘cum tuis (annis).' The cons. of contribuere with cumis unique (Caes.
B.C. 1, 60 is not a parallel, rnoreover the text is doubtful) and appears to
reflect the original meaning of contribuere, ‘to bring, place, or put together,’
when the force of curn in the compound was still felt.

66. sanguis: really = sarrgnins, hence the prosody, so Lucret. 4, 105o;
6, 1263, Verg. Α. 10, 487 and occasionally in all periods, eg. Ouid, Met. 10,
4521226488, Lyceum& 72⁶3s; 10,128; Sil·1ta1·9‚555; 10‚23;
Val. Flacc. 3, 234, etc. Confusion with other forms in ·is had begua before
Vergil’s time, cp. eg. G. 3, 508, Α. 2, 639, 5, 396. For the use of the word
in this figurative sense, cp. Horace, Carm. Soet. 5ο, Theokrit. 24, 71, etc.

67-68. The poet’s only reference to Delia's social position, see Introd.
p.44andcp.4, 10, 3.

The stola had been the exclusive privilege of matronae since as early at
least as the Second Punic War (Macrob. 1, 6, 13). It was not worn even by
ingenuae if unmarried. The vitineas a distinctive portion ofa matrona’s
costume are mentioned as early as Plaut. Milet Glor. 791. Marquardt quotes
passages to support his contention that unmarried girls, if ingenuae, could
wear vittae (though of a distinctiva type). They could not be worn by
slaves, freedwomen, peregrinae, or meretrices (Afranius, 133 R.; Varro, Sat.
Men. 302 B.) All seems to point to the conclusion that Delia belonged either de
facto or de iure to the libertinae. Passages like Ovid, Ars Amat. 1, 31, 2, 6ου,
3, 483, Fasti, 4, 134, Trist. 2, 247; Pom. 3, 3, 5¹· etc. show why quanvis
fiis a natural and reasonable qualification of carta. The limitatione of the
marriage law were such that no libertina could better her position by culti·
vating the ideal of pure womanhood or even by observingfrdelity to one lover.

67. asta: 1, 3, 83 n. But in Martial's time it was curiously enough con·
sidered more disgraceful for a married woman to have one lover than to
possess several, cp. 6, 9ο, 3, 92, Sen. Ben. 3, 16, 3

69-74. Imitated by Bertin, cp. 1, 5, 71-74 n.

⁶⁹· durae leges: r, 5, 7n.; 2‚4, 52, Propert. 4, 8, 74, etc—ullam: also
used as a substantive in 2, 1, 9.

7o. oculos appetat: a conventional symptorn of feminine jealousy and of
feminine anger generally, cp. Propert. 3, 8, 5, 3, 15, 143 4, 8, 64, Ovid,
Her. 20, 82; Amor. 2, 7, 7; esp. Ars Amat. 2, 452.
