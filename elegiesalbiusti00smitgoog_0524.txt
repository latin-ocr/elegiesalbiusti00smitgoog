used presente itself again: and Shalrespeate seems to have been not a little
liable to this literary habit. It is not uncommon for him to use a word or
phrase twice in a single play and never afterwards! Lastly of the resem-
blances to Propertius (for details see notes on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 18, 21)
Professor Postgate says, ‘The reader has them before him and can judge for
himself whether the resemblances taken as a whole are or are not too close
and too frequent to be due to accident! Ι confess Icannot see as many
coincidences here as does Professor Postgate. What is of greater importance‚
however, Ι fail to see how the settlement of this question either for or against
has any necessary connection with the genuineness of this poem.

On the whole, therefore, Ι arn inclined to believe that this poem was the
work of ,Tibullus The relation of the idyllic erotic elegy of Tibullus to the
Alexandrian erotic epigram has already been discnssed (Introd. p. 23).
This poem suggests so strongly the influence of Catullus and the Alexandrian
type just mentioned that we may fairly class ir as itself an epigram. It is also
manifestly inferior to our poet's best published work. lt seems most reason·
able therefore to suppose that it isachance survivor from an earlier stage
of his development, and that it was kept back¹ by the author himself because
it did not measure up to the higher standards of his critical and creative
maturity.

1. Lit. ‘No woman shall steal your couch (rie. your love) from me! The
choice of this expression instead of the more commonplace ‘no woman shall
win me away from you,’ was dictated by the poet’s desire to lay all possible
emphasis on the supreme value to him of her love as a possession. He there·
fore states his infidelity in terms as it were of the loss of her love. subducere
lectum, which does not occur elsewhere in Latin, is (as noted by the old
commentator Achilles Statius) clearly an echo of Soph. Elekt. 113 (speak-

ing of the Erinnyes), al τοὺς ἀδίκως θνήσκοντας ὁρᾶθ’, Ι al τοὺς εὐνὰς tls-orhem- Ι ,

says (1, 8, 45), ‘nec mihi rivalis certos subducit amores,' but w'e cannot
assume that he had this line in mind; on the other hand it is sufficiently clear
that Tibullus was not borrowing from. Propertius—subducet: only here in
the Tibullian corpus; Propertius, 1, 8, 453 3, 2, 23 in this sense- lectum:
εὐνή, cp. 1, 5,7 n.; for toro cp. 4, 10, 6; etc.

and notes. For Venus, 1‚4‚ 59 n.; 1‚9,76; 14 below; etc.
