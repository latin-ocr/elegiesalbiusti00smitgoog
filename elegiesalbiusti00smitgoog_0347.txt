4. praecinit eventus: 1, 6, 5ο.

5-6. Tibullus says he has learned by bitter experience to know the signs.
This is a t'avourite turn of Propertius, cp. 1, 9, 7, ‘me dolor et lacrimae merito
fecere peritum: Ι atque utinam positodicar amore rudis ’; 3, 8, 17.

Α1112112122ἕ211(1,5,5 n.,cp.2.4,3; 2, 6, 5 and notes) the lover con·
stantly adopts the altitude os a slave, esp. of a slave undergoing torment at
the hands of Cupid, Venus, etc, cp. eg. Propert. 3, 24, 13, ‘correptus saevo
Veneris torrebar aeno, Ι vinctus eram versas in mea terga manus’ (where the
first line contains another favourite figure, that os love as a fire over which the
victimis coolred,Propert. 3, 6, 393 Anti. Pal. 12, 92, 93 a similar use of
‘fry' in the old Eng. poets; etc). Again the lover isa captive of Cupid and
adorns his triumph as in Ovid, Antor. 1, 2. Here the slave oi love is bound
and scourged -the reflection ol another common idea that Cupid himselt'is
utterly cruel and heartless, cp. 1, 3, 64; 1, 6, 2; 1, ro, 58 and notes.

5. magico nodo: the idea of binding runs all through sorcery, cp. such
details of ritual as 1, 3, 31; 1, 5,15; 2, 1,15-16 with notes; words like
legare, defixere, solvere, etc. The most natural and striking symbolism ol this ’
idea is knots3 ‘necte tribus nodis ternos, Amarylli, colores; Ι necte, Amarylli
modo et “Veneri ” dic “ vincula nect0,’'' says the sorceress in Vergil, E. 8,78,
a single ex. os the many that might be quoted. The ‘true lover’s knot’ is
one of the last survivors. Tbere is no trace, however, ol' an actual nodm
Veneris (cp. the nodus Herculis used ln medicine and represented on the
caducens os Hermes, Pliny, 28, 635 Sen. Epist. 87, 38; Macrob. 1,19, 16;
Festus, 63; Cornut. Theoi. Graec. 16, p. 22, Lang; Athen. 11, 500 Α, 212.)
although Venus was nevertheless asorceress (1, 2, 43¹ n). The peculiarity of
all magic knots is that one cannot untie them without knowing the necessary
charm. Hence magico here evidently means ‘strong’ ‘indissoluble,’ with a
suggestion perhaps ol ‘wondrous,' ‘mysterious,’ as in Ovid, Her. 4, 136, ‘illa
coit firma generis iunctura catena 1 imposuit nodos cui Venus ipsa suos’;
Lucret. 4, 1147-1148, ‘nonita difficile est quarn captum retibus ipsis Ι 211112 21
validos Veneris perrumpere nodos) Similar exx. os mag-icus in an extended
sense appear to be very uncommon, cp. however Juv. 15,’5, ‘dimidio magi-
cae resonant ubi Memnone chordae,’ i.e. not lar from our common use os
magical = ‘wonderful’ ‘mysterium'

6. perdocuit: note the force ol the prep. Venus islond of wielding the
scourge upon her slaves, 3, 4, 66; Hor. Od. 3, 26,11,‘regina (tle. Venus),
sublimi flagello 1 tange Chloen semel arrogantem’; Mart. 6, 21, 9, ‘dixit et
arcano percussit pectora loro ’ς Anti. Pal. 5, 254, 7,· Nonnos‚ 4, 177 ; 212.

7-8. Another important article in the lover’s creed; cp. eg. Eurip. Happol.
