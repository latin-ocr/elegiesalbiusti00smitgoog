Next to Catullus the most notable of the elegiae poets for the number, variety,
and freedom of his elisions is Propertius. Tibullus is particularly strict and
hardly less sparing even than Ovid. But elision is only slightly less frequent
in Ovid’s Carmina Amatoria than in Tibullus: the growing dislike of elisiou
is also seen in the fact that Oyid shows a teudency to confine it more to cer·
tain fixed phrases and combinations. The percentage of lines in which eli·
sion occurs is about as follows: Catullus, 39·5⁰l›; Propertius, 23⁰4, ; Tibullus,
(1 and 2), 104 ⁰45 Ovid, 89⁰4. ‚Of these the percentage of lines containing
two elisions is Catullus, 5.2⁰l0; Propertius, {3⁰43 Tibullus, 047ss, (1, 5, 395
2, 1, 61, 65, and 673 4, 5, 5 ; 4, 13, 16) ; Ovid, 0.35⁰l⁰, with a steady though
small diminution from the Amores to the Rem. Amor. (about 20 years).
6 lines with three elisions are found iu Propertius and 2 in Catullus; with
4elisions only one each in Propertius and Catullus. On the whole, elision
is always freest in the first half of the verse. In the second hemistich of the
pentameter elision is most frequent (though still not common) in the end of
the last dactyl, but elision in the fifth thesis, occasional in Propertius and
growing considerably in Ovid, is never found in Tibullus. Elision is increas-
ingly more frequent in the hex. than in the peut, but the difference is never
very large.

As regards the quantity of the vowels concerned, the freest and most com-
mon is a short before a short. This must occur, of course, iu the arsis ofa
dactyl; when in the first syllable of the arsis Tibullus usually confines it to
the first foot and as a rule to such extra light words as atque, saepe, que, ille,
etc.; not as common in the second syllable, aud except in the first foot with
a teudency to drop off in the second book. Elision ofa short before a long
generally occurs before a monosyllable (independent or in composition), and
as a rule, ictus and word accent agree. Elision of a long before a long is also
subject to the same preference for the monosyllable, but in this case conflict at
the thesis is the rule. Only in Boolr 1 do we find elisions so abnormal for
Tibullus as 1, 2, 58, ‘de me uno,' ancl 1, 4, 56, ‘se implicuisse! Elision of a
long before a short is harsh and generally found only in old, popular, or inex·
perienced poets. The only exx.·iu Tib. vidi ego, r, 2, 89, and illi etiam, 2, 1,
41, both in the first short of the first dactyl. These, however, had already be-

come phraseological. We find them regularly in Ovid, and always in the same ᾗ
place iu the verse, ag. vidi ego, Amor. r, 2, rr,; 2,2,47; 2, ι2,25; 3, 4, l
13, etc. So too aequo animo, Amor. 2, 7, 123 certe ego, Her. 1, 115, and ¹

the like, which we never find in Tibullus. —solitot for the touch, 1, r, 43.
