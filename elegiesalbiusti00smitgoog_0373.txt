³⁷· tallere doctus: r, 7, 20 n.

39. Note that we have here in lieu of a regular apodosis a passionate
rhetorical question in which the tense ossariam indicates that the question
lspractically independent, i.e. that the protasis was really au aiterthought.
The unusual syntax is au admirable reflection ol the poet's high tension and

, oi the rapid shiit of mood so characteristic of his tace, cp. 4, 13, 5-6n.

The cool logical statement would have been something like Ἰ should
punish you ss you deserve unless you were,' etc. But the poet is not cool.
‘quid laciam,' he eries, ior the moment thinking ol nothing else. Then
comes a protasis the entire regularity ol which reflects the calming eilect ol a
thought which in his rage he had sailed to consider. ‘What shall 1 do with
you? But no: you yoursell ,are in love with a girl-therefore 1 spare you)
-et lpse: rai αὐτός, here not ‘you too,' but ‘you yoursell are also,' r'.e. ‘in
spite ol your other aiiair you are,' etc—fores: lor esses, cp. 1, 10, 11 and note.
· The rule in Catullus and very frequent in the Augustan period, esp. in the
poets, notably in Ouid, cp. also Propert. 3, 14, 333 2, 15, 46; 3, 8, 363 24, 8;
1,10, 203 2, 25, 353 29, 28; 4, 5, 74. Preierably as here in the protasis oi
an unreal condition, cp. Ovid, Met. 8, 46, ‘sed nisi bella forent, numquid
mihi cognitus esseti' Hor. Sat. 1, 5, 593 Plautus, Trin.1127; 832; etc.
(See Blase, in Stolz, Hisr. Gram. der Lat. Spr. 2, p. 280.)-tn amore
puellae: i.e. ‘nisi puellam amares,’ the gen. is objective. Il puellae were
subjective gen. ss eg. in Script. Hist. Aug. Had 2, 7, ⁴ luitque (Hadrianus)
in amore Traiani,' or ilpuellae were dative as eg. in Cicero, Verr. 4, 3, ‘quae
(civitas) tibi una iu amore atque in deliciis t'uit,’ then ‘nisi . . puellae’ would
= ‘nisi a puella amareris! Note however that iu any case the ambiguity is
more apparent than real, since in the phrase ‘esse inaniore (or amicitia)
alicuius, alicui, curu aliqu0,’ although emphasis may be laid on one side or the
other according to the construction selected, the state of mind indicatedis
always mutual, ‘mutuo amant amantur’-which of course adds a special
stiug to the wish os 40. The puella here is usually identified with the Pholoe
of 1, 8.

40. ‘nisi . . . puellae’ had cooledthepoet’swrath. But the mere mention
ol the girl instantly suggested another catalogue os wrongs. Hence the
second burst ot' wrath in 40 which leads us to the enumeration os them. ‘But
1 pray she may learn the lesson of fickleness from you,’ ‘Qu’elle soit, pour ta
peine, autaut que toi traltresse‚’ says Martinon. Ι

41-44. Two more examples ol the obsequium inculcated by Priapus, cp. 1,
4, 39 l. and notes.

41-42. In antiquity (cp. 1, 2, 35 and notes), as eg. in mediaeval London,
the streets were not regularly lighted, hence, after dark, waysarers were
