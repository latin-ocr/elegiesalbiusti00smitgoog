should be added, too, that rare as it is, the Roman treatment of the feminine
caesura is rarely the same as that of the Greeks. The general rule is that
when the feminine caesura is used, it should be accompanied by both a semi·
ternaria and-a semiseptenaria, thus (1, ι, 11) -

nam veneror! seu stipes Ι habet Ι desertus in agris.

The result, it will be seen, is really a tripartite verse in which the feminine
caesura in the middle is reduced, so to speak‚ to a minimum. Twenty per
cent (140 odd exx.) of Tibullus's verses, an unusually large number for a Ro·
man poet, have the feminine caesura. Nearly 81⁰!⁰ of this number (111 out
of ι 37) are accompanied by the two secondary caesuras. Of the two second·
ary caesuras the semiternaria is preferred, i.e., as before, agreement in the
first hemistich is more tolerable than in the second. So in the example be·
fore us, of which there are 25 exx. in Tibullus-

quisquis amore tenetur Ι eat Ι tutusque sacerque

in which eat, ie. an iambic word following the caesura, illustrates the only
way in such circumstances of renewing conflict in the second hemistich. On
the other hand, 1, 10, 39—

. quam potius Ι laudandus Ι hic est quem prole parata

is the only example in Tib. in which the semiseptenaria is obscured. A femi·
nine caesura unsupported is never found in Tib. and is very rare elsewhere.

Τὴε caesura septenaria is very rare, and when it occurs it should be ac·
companied by a semiternaria, thus-

ferte et opes: Ι ego composito Ι securus acervo,
