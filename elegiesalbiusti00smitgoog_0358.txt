NOTES [ι, 8, 50

45-46. Montaigne, 1, chap. 40, quotes these lines in connection with his
remark, ‘Qui n’a ouy parler a Paris de celle qui se fit escorcher pour seule·
ment en acquerir le teint plns l'rais d’une nouvelle pean ?'

45. Propert. 3, 25, 13, ‘vellere tum cupias albos a stirpe capillos! The
anecdote os Julia in Macrob. 2, 5, 7 suggests the apologue ol Phaedrus, 2, 2.

46. dempta pelle: the story just quoted from Montaigne might suggest
that the poet literally meant ‘by removing the skin! Cp. too, Johnson, Ram-
bler, No. 133. pellis is especially used ol animala, although in poetry it may be
used os human beings (instead cicutis). ‘dempta pelle,’ however, corresponds
to ‘tollere albos capillos’ iu the hexameter and hence pelle is here pejorative
(like our colloquial ‘hide’). Further the emphatic contrast with novamfiaciem
also aids in showing tbat pelle (‘the wrinkled old hide’) is really synecdoche,
ale. the whole instead ol' tbe part evidently meant (and so Heyne). pelle then
would be equivalent to rugis. Doubtless too the phrase was suggested by the
idea that the serpent renevvs his youth when he sheds his skin, cp. 1, 4, 35-36. n.

Many recipes l'or removing wrinkles were in use. Pliny and Seren. Sammon.
recommend gum-mastic, cp. Pliny, 24, 43, ‘mastiche lentisci replicandis pal·
pebris et ad extendendam cutem in lacie,' etc.; Seren. Sammon 154, ‘rugarum
sulcos lentisci mastice tendens,' etc. It will be seen that the principle here, as
t'ar as it goes, is the same as that ol modern massage. The second and more
common method was not to try to remove the wrinlrles but to conceal them.
ΤΙιε process in this case was, so to upsali, ‘to putty them up’ with various
concoctions, cp. lomentum in the dictt.; Apul. Met. 8, 27, ‘facie caenoso pig-
mento delita et oculis obunctis grafice'3 Juv. 6, 4613 Mart. 3, 42, 1, etc.;
6, 93, 93 Hor. Epod. 12, 105 Clemens Alex. Pnid. 3, 2, 75 etc. These fore-
shadow the even more barbarous practice ol ‘enamelling' in modern times.

47-48. 1, 1, 69-74; 1, 4, 27 and notes.

47. at tur that is, in distinction lrorn those persons above who followed your
present course until it was too late. The plain personal application ol the
lesson is reserved till the end. It is thus more emphatic and at the same time
serves as a transition to the next point. This emphatic atis characteristic ol
Tib, cp. 1, 1, 33 n.-primi temporis aetas: the note on aetas in ι, 4, 27 will
show that there is no real pleonasm here; cp. also Propert. 1, 4, 7, ‘formosi
temporis aetas'; 1,7, 8, aetatis tempora dura'; Lucret. 1, 558,‘infinita aetas
anteacti temporis omnis,’ etc.

49-50. The poet returns to the charge ol 29-30 and proceeds in the tol-
lowing lines to develop it lrorn a different point of view.

49· puero quae gloria, etc. ι ι, 6, 3, n.

50. vetares senes: ‘tough seniors,' hardened old sinners. veteres brings
out the contrast with puero above as well as with tenero below, ‘a congruent
