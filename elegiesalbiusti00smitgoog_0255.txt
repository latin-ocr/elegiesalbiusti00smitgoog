Ι, 3. 45] TlBVLLVS

preserved in the primitive. For these reasons it is often preferred by the
poete-esp. by the poets and the poetizing prose of the Silver Age—to
call the reader’s attention to the metaphor involved. We find no large use
of this device, nor ought we to expect it, in the studied simplicity of Tibullus;
cp. however mittere for dimittere, 1, 3, 9 ; tenere for retinere, 1, 3, 183 dare
for reddere, 1, 5, 163 ridere for arridere (i), 1, 8, 733 solari for consolari, 2,
6, 253 etc. On the other hand, concinuisse for cecinisse, a, 5, 10 (where see
note).

45-46. The poet echoes here (cp. 61 below) one of the rnost persistent
and characteristic features of the old folk legend; this is the belief that
in the Golden Age all the imaginable blessings of life came of their own
accord. When treated seriome this motive led, as we have seen (43-44 ιι.),
to the theory of communism; when treated by satirists or by people of a
less serious turn of mind, the same motive led quite as directly to one of the
most important and interesting developments in the literary history of this
legend. This is the treatment of the Golden Age or of its analogues in this
world or the next as a comic theme. lt makes its first appearance in the
writers of the Old comedy, and was primarily intended hy thern to satirize

the peculiar tenets of the Orphics. lt is really, however, a folk variation and ’

references to it turn up now and then from the Old comedy of Greece to the
present day. The one best known to us is given by the old Trouvere in his
lay of the ‘Land of Cocagne! The comedy is usually produced by pushing
the automatous element, occasionally too the theory of communiam, to its
perfectly logical and yet at the same time its utterly absurd conclusion. Not
only do the sheep, as here, corne home voluntarily to be milked (so eg. Verg.

E. 4, 213 Hor. Epod 16, 493 ete), but roast pigs run about asking to be ,

eaten (Petron. 45) and we hear about rivers of wine (Verg. G. 1, 132), also
of milk and of nectar (Ovid, Met. ¹r, ιιι), and even of broth, the last with
pieces of hot meat rolling along in the flood (Teleklides, frag. 1 Kock;
Lukian, Vera Hist. 2, 13, ete), the table sets itself, the food passes itself to

the guests, etc. The result is a Lost Paradise of the bon vivant, the votary
of ease, and the irresponsible bacheler. Here Tib. contents himself with de·
scribing the kingdom of Saturn as a laud flowing with milk and honey-a
proverb of abundance among the Greeks and Romans as wellas among the
Hebrews (Eurip. Bacch. 1413 Hor. Od. 2, 19, 103 Exod. 3, 8; Joshua, 5, 6, ete).

45. ipsae: of themselves, cp. 2, 6, 14, ie. without the intervening agency
of the bees. The allusion is to a widespread popular conception that honey,
the food of the gods, and one of their chief gifts to men, was the product of
the ether itself (‘ aerii tuellis caelestia dona,' Verg. G. 4, 1; μέλι δὲ τὸ
πῖπτον ἐκ τοῦ ἀέρος rui μάλιστα ἐν τοῖς τῶν ἄστρων ἐπιτολαΐι rai ὅταν
