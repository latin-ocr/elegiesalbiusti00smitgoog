TIBVLLVS

three poenis indicate a stage of development too acute to allow '

for the intervention of birthday celebrations and such compara-
tively indifferent matters, we may perhaps arrange the six poems
thus: 4, 8 and 4, 9 in immediate successi0n; 4, 11 before or
aster 4,8and 4, 93 then 4, 12, 4, 1o ; 4,7in the order named.
From 4, 8 we leam that Sulpicia has been expecting to see
Cerinthus on her birthday. She now writes him that Messalla
has just announced his intention of taking her for an outing in
the country, with the object, it would seem, of making her
birthday an unusually pleasant occasion. Of course the fore-
most thought in her mind is that Cerinthus will not be there,
and the girlish keenness of her disappointment is seen in every
line. ‘My hateful old birthday,’ she exclaims‚ ‘is coming, and
the dreary hours of it must be passed in the stupid country, and
without Cerinthus! The amusing side of the situation for the
onlooker is the fact that poor Messalla’s extra effort to please
his niece was evidently coupled with a blissful ignoranee of the
importance of Cerinthus in her scheme of lif. Of course the
attention was well meant, but it was all the more irritating for
that very reason. Yet upon this piece are founded such solemn
assertione of earlier scholars as that Messalla was in love with
Sulpicia, that she disliked him, and that she hated the country.
Perhaps Messalla realized that for some occult reason his
niece showed no great interest in his suggestion. At any rate
in her next letter to Cerinthus (4, 9) Sulpicia writes that the
proposed journey has been given up, and that her birthday will
be spent at home ras originally planned. It will be observed
that she no longer calls it her ‘hateful old birthday! Possibly
4, 5 and 4, 6, in the previous group, were originally suggested
by these two pieces It is likely too that 4, 4-the poem on
an illness of Sulpicia—is to be connected in a similar fashion
with 4, 11, in which Sulpicia herself writes a touching letter to
Cerinthus on the same theme. The theme is traditional, and
the thoughts are not new ς but for beauty, tenderness, and good
