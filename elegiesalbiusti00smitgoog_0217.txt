1, 2, 25a] TIBVLLVS

a5a. sinit occurrat: with the imperative of sino the complementary final
subjunctive without ut is common3 with the finite forms of sino, as here and
in 1, 4, 25, it is rare and generally poetic, eg. Ovid, Met. 3, 377 ς no exx. in
Propertius. After verbs of willing or demanding the subjunctive regularly
takes ut. In Tibullus however, this use of ut is found only after imperare, 2,

3, 34 (ne, 4, 2‚4aud 4, ιο, 6; qui, 4, 6, 15). But if,as here, the idea of
wishing is emphatic, the simple subjunctive is used; so after orare, 1, 2, ⁶45
velle, 1, 9, 49; persuadere, 1, 9, 70 (very rare, see n.) ; rogare, 1, 9, 843 4,
5, 8; nealle, 2, 3, 32; vetare, 2, 6, 3⁶3 precari, 1, 2, 123 1, 9, 40 ;¹ 1,3‚
5, 83 and 93 3 1, 6, 56, like docere, 1, 6, 67, may be explained as parenthetical.
ll the verb of willing and wishing is used as a verb of saying und thinking, as
is often the case, the infinitive must of course he used. On the one example
ol a simple subjunctive (complementary consecutive)] after sacia, see 1, 3,
54, n. —- corpora: the plural is generic.

ati. This type of footpad (Gk. λωποδύτης) isoften mentioned; cp. the refer-
ences under asa-26 above, and Alexis, frag. 107, K.; Soph. frag. Eleg. 3Crus.
The old Latin name for him was praeunctum· Naevius, 17, R., ‘namin scaena
vos nocturnos coepit praemiatores tollere! He snatched the garments aud
afterwards sold them for whatever price (praemium) he could get -generally
near nightfall and naturally to a class by whom no inconvenient questions
were likely to be asked. For such a scene see esp. Petron. 14. The weekly
market at Rome in the Campo dei Fiori used to be somewhat of this character.

27-28. Mustard cites Pontanus, Amores, bk. 2 (spea'king of Amor) —

ille per oppositas secreto limite turmas
ducit, et hostiles praeterit insidias.

ille iter in tenebris explorat et obvia monstrat,
hoc duce per Syrtes fit via tuta mihi.

On the legal and religious associations of sacer, see the lexicons. The
lover is a devotee of Venus; he-is therefore not only safe but sacrosanct;
cp. 1, 6, 51-543 4, 4, 14-15; Propon. 3, 16, 11-14; Ovid, Amor. 1, 6, 9-14;
Anth. Pal. 5, 25 ; 5, 213, etc. A slight extension of the primitive and per-
sistent idea also frequently met in the amatory poets and elsewhere, that
poets, prophets, lunatics‚ or any persons subject to the eustatie state are pos·
sessed by some god and therefore beings set ap'art, 2, 5, 113-114 n.

27. Note that the caesura is trochaic and that, unlike 35 for example, it is
not accompanied by ‘ conflict' in the first hemistich. Owing to the familiar
and invariable laws of Latin accent already established in Cicero’s time the
