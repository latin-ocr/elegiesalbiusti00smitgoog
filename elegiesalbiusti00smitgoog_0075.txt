TIBVLLVS

poraries with whom he was doubtless on the best oi terms, that ¹

he never mentions or discusses the tradition ol his department in
the past, that he makes no acknowledgemeut of literary inspira-
tion‚ no confession of literary saith—how shall we explain these
phenornena? The question is no longer capable ofa final and
definite reply. It is perhaps worth observing however that all
these matters seem out ol place iu the strictly idyllic type. Even
the mollitia with which he has been charged aud the absence ol
certain more serious aspirations, though possibly due to individual
limitations, are nevertheless in harmony with the traditions ol his
model. The conventional love affair ol the elegy follows simple
lines, the beaten paths of antique as well as ol modern sentiment
do not lead to the highest ground. Above all the idyllic mood
does not and should not mount to the lonely peaks os contempla·
tion and the wider outlooks ol the spirit.

We must of course admit the claim that he does not show the
daring imagination of Propertius nor betray the same ardour ol
temperament, but such passages as the awlul picture of wolf-mad-
ness in r, 5, 49 ff. (the more awlul because merely suggested), the
sinister hint ol 1, a, 39-4o‚ the infernal art ol the invective in r,
9, 53 ft, the emotional stress ol a, 4, 5 ff., are momentary
glimpses ol a new Tibullus; and they suggest a poet quite capable
ol producing lights aud shades ol the most startling sort, if he had
chosen to transgress the sels-imposed laws of his own literary code.

It is also beyond question that he does not possess the inex·
haustible vivacity and wit, the iniectious animal spirits, of Ouid.
At the same time one of the notable characteristics oi Tibullus is
his humour, and readers of Theokritos and the Bucolic poets will
not fail to perceive that the vein is that which was always more or
less characteristic ol the idyllic mood throughout the Alexandrian
Age. The ‘gentle elegiac melancholy ’ oi Tibullus, in reality oue
ol his less important moods‚ is stilla commonplace of criticism.
It is hard to see however how any sympathetic reader can succeed
in missing the humour of the situation in r, 2, the satire ol 1, 4, the
