the usual cons, with componere is ad4accus. The dative (rare and poetic ῑ

with this verb) tends to personify famae, ‘for Mrs. Grundy '3 Lucan, 3, 596,

‘semper venturis componere carbasa ventis,' (the winds are all gods in antique 1

folk belief); 3, 717, 'me quoque mittendis rectum componite telis! 7
10. cum . . . fuisse: Varro, L. L. 6, 8ο, ‘violavit virginem pro vitiavit ¹

dicebant ; aeque eadem modestia potius cum muliere fuisse quam concubuisse ;
dicebant! The euphemis'm (cp. Greek, συνεῖναι) occurs throughout the l

language.—cum digno, etc. : the wish echoes the pride of a patrician (cp. 4,

10, Introd. and 3-4 11.) 01111 is nowhere stated with greater terseness and 1

simplicity, cp. Ovid, Her. 17, 49 (Helen speaking of Leda), ‘illa bene erravit
vitiumque auctore redemit: Ι felix inculpa quo Iove dicar ego ?' Hor, 011, 1,
27, 15, ‘non erubescendis adurit Ι ignibus ingenuoque semper Ι 0111010
peccas! —cum digno digna: ie. ‘one worthy of me as 1 am worthy of birn.’
This rhetorical device (1, 9, 80 11.) 01 immediately repeating the substantive,
eg. ‘like to like,’ ‘when Greek meets Greek,' etc, is not esp. common in
English. Τ110 object 01 11 10 10 state tbe thought with brevity, point, 01111
emphasis. 11 emphasizes the idea of equivalence or equality, it is 0 short cut
to the striking statement 01 reciprocity or mutuality, etc. Latin is rich in
such expressions and they occur in all types 01 literary art, cp. ag. Verg. G.
2, 327, ‘magnus alit magno commixtus'; Catull. 34, 5, ‘0 Latonia, 1001111111
magna progenies Iovis’; Hor. Od. 1, 16, 1, ‘o matre pulchra filia pulchrior’3
’010 They are especially characteristic however 01 the antique and the
homely, aa eg. in proverbs, ‘manus manum lavat’3 in conversational tage,
‘amicus amico’; in literary departments like the comedy, and in tbe old
'writers in general, Plautus, Asin. 31, ‘nam me illuc ducis ubi lapis lapidem
terit ?'; Rudem, 434, ‘quam hostis hosti commotlat’3 Most. 1075, ‘adsum
praesens praesenti tibi'; Amphit. 726, ‘immo vigilans vigilantem’; 786,
‘nuncsi patera pateram peperit omnes congeminavimus ’ς etc. The one 101111

rule the nominative (rarely tbe accusative) precedes. The chief references κ
