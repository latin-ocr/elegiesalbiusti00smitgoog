TIBVLLVS

bullus. But Propertius was undoubtedly apoet oi the first rank, '
and with the publication oi his first book the world made haste
to recognize the fact ; he was taken up by Maecenas, his name
was in every one’s mouth. Tibullus published his own first book
at about the same time.l He knew its artistic'merit he knew
there were a lew readers who would appreciate its superiority from¹
that point oi view. But he also knew that with the larger public
it was overshadowed by the brilliant work oi his rival. The effect
of such a disappointment upon a man oi Tibullus’s temperament
can be easily imagined. Indeed the very emphasis with which
Horace assures his friend that his literary glory is secure, is enough
to justisy us in suspecting that the last years ol our poeb’s briei lile
were perhaps occasionally haunted by the fear that he was
destined never to realize his one consuming ambition, a'perma-
nent place in the Roman Temple oi Fame.

Ill. LATER TRADITION ANDUIMITATION

In his own time however audior many years to come, the
reputation oi Tibullus as a poet was the equal ol his reputation

as a man. The tender verses oi QriQsMarsus, whose bitter

and much attention has been given to the various coincidences in theme, thought,
and expression. See esp. Jacoby, Rhein. Mus„ 65, p. aa fi, whose statements and
conclusions are many oi them, it seems to me, in need ol considerable revision.
The first book of Propertius (see 2, 31) was perhaps published soon alter October
ol 28, the first book oi Tibullus (see 1, 7) about a year later. But attempts to
prove imitation, still moreto prove which was the imitator, are not especially
profitable. No one ior instance knows how long the poeuis ol both were circu·
lated before publication. The first three books oi Propertius had all been pub-
lished when Tibullus was writing his second book. But even here, as in the first
book, the loss ol Gallus as well as ol practically all the Greek background makes
it impossible to tell how many such resemblances are due to a common or a sim-
ilar source. Where the two poets have dealt with the same theme, they have de-
veloped it each in his own way. Which way is better is a matter of taste, and
nothing is gained by attempting to exploit either at the expense oi the other. The
last book ol Propertius was published, and some at least oi the pieces in it were

' written, alter the death ol Tibullus.
