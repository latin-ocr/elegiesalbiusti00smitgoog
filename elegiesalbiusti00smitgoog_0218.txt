two feet, demanded iu at least oue) is of great importauce iu the develop-
ment 0f this verse by the Roman poets. The observance of this law—the
’ effect aud, therefore, the real artistic reason for which was to preserve, if
Zielinski is correct, the regular pronunciation of the period when artistic
poetry aud prose were first developed-is seen especially in the doctrine
of the caesura, above all of the secondary (masculine) caesuras, the real
object of which must have been to produce that ‘conflict’ by which they are
always accompauied.

The favourite caesura, therefore, is tbe semiquinaria (ae. f, also known as .
the penthemimeral and ‘masculine’ caesura), thus-

Divitias Ι alius ΙΙ fulvo Ι sibi congerat auro.

Of the more than 200,ooo¹ Roman hexameters still surviving over 80‘7⁰ have
this caesura. The reasons for it are: 1, it is distinct; 2, it allows either a
dactyl or a spondee in the third foot3 3, it always produces conflict at that
point; 4, with it, conflict in the second and especially in the fourth foot is
most easily obtained (i.e. by making the end of any word but a monosyllable
coincide with the thesis (ictus) in each case, as in the example quoted).
Usually, therefore, the semiquinaria isaccompanied by one or both of these
secondary caesuras (semiternaria, l, ancl semiseptenaria, ἦ). Neartysoy, of
Tibullus’s hexameters have the semiquinaria, but large aa it ia, this proportion
is s'maller than that of Propertius, and still smaller thau that of Ovid, whose
fondness for this caesura is very marked. ln the majority of cases the semi-
quinaria is accompanied by both secondary caesuras. Of the two secondary

caesuras the semiternaria is the more easily dispensed with, ae. (and this, too, ’

is a general rule) agreement of ictus aud regular word accent is more tolerable
iu the first than in the second hemistich. Agreement in the second hemistich
is generally relieved by bucolic diaeresis, thus (1, 1, 7) —

ipse seram Ι teneras ΙΙ maturo 1 tempore vites.

Still more is this the case when agreement extends to both hemistichs, thus
(1, r, 21) —
tunc vitula innumeros ΙΙ lustrabat 1 caesa iuvencos.

The only exception seems to be 1, 9, 83-
hanc tibi fallaci ΙΙ resolutus amore Tibullus.

The caesura κατὰ τρίτον τροχαῖον (the trochaie or ‘feminine' caesura) was
the favourite with Homer and in the later Greek poets, esp. Nonuos and his
school, practically became universal. By the Roman poets, on the contrary,
it was shunned for the same reasons that the semiquinaria was cultivated. lt
