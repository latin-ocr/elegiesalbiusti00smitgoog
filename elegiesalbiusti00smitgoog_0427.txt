2, 3, 43] TIBVLLVS

43. cui curae est: for the 'double dat. 1, 5, 291. cui is also to be taken

with portatur and claudit-lapis externus: refers to that well-known
fondness for expensive marbles of diflerent colours most of which were brought
from a distance (externus, cp. Hor. od. 2, 18, 33 Propert. 3, 2, 11; Seneca,
Thyest. 646; Phaed. 496; Stat. Silv. 1, 3, 35; 1, 5, 36; etc.)‚ ateste which
made Rome magnificent and which, it is interesting to observe, has recently
been revived in our own country by the recurrence for the first time since

then of asimilar age 01 wealth and luxury-urbisque tumultu: ablative 01 ³

manner, cp. 1, 2, 20,‘pedem ponere nullo sono’; 1, 7, 13, ‘fluere tacitis
undis’; 1, 8, 60, ‘strepitu nullo reserare'; 15, ‘inculto ore venire’; 2, 3, 33,
‘tristi fronte imperare,’ etc.

The reference here and in the following line is to the transportation 01
great loads 01 stone and timber through the narrow and crowded streete 01
Rome, a coustant source 01 noise, confusion, aud danger. 'l’he famous,

passage in point is Juv. 3, 254, ‘longa coruscat Ι serraco veniente abies, atque 1
altera pinum Ι plaustra vehunt3 nutant alte populoque minantur. Ι narn si pro· Ἴ

cubuit qui saxa Ligustica portat Ι axis et eversum fudit super agmina montem

Ι quid superest de corporibus,' etc.; Seneca, Epist. 90, 9, ‘felix illud saeculum Ι

aute architectos fuit, ante tectores. . . . 101 01111 tecta cenationi epulum re-
cepturae parabantur, nec in hunc usum pinus aut abies deferebatur longo
vehiculorum ordine vicis intrementibus, ut ex illa lacunaria auro gravia
penderent’; Mart. 5, 22, 7, ‘vixque datur longas mulorum rumpere mandras Ι
quaeque trahi multo marmora fune vides’; Pliny, Pan. 51, 1, ‘idem tam
parcus in aedificando quam diligens in tuendo. itaque non ut ante immanium
transvectione saxorum urbis tecta quatiuntur; stant securae domus nec iam
templa nutantia’ (cp. Seneca, N. Q. 6, 22, 13 Lucret. 6, 548); Ηο1. Epist.
2, 2, 72; etc.

1145 ue. (CIL. Ι, p. 121) Caesar passed an ordinance that no ‘heavy ,
teaming' should be allowed iu the streete 01 Rome between 11111110 and two ,

hours before sunset, ie. during the hours of congestion 101 1001 passengers.
An exception (among others) was made in favour 01 public works and demoli-

tionprojects. The object 01 the law was eflected, and it seems to have held ¹

good not only in the time 01 our poet but for at least the 11111 two centuries

01 the empire, but the result must have been that, thanks to the heavy traffic 1

for public works allowed by day and 101 private individuals by night, the roar
in the business section of Rome was practically continuone from sun 10 sun.
Hence the law 01 Hadrian (Spart. Scripta Hirr. Aug. 1, 22, 6, ‘vehicula cum
ingentibus sarcinis urbem ingredi prohibuit ⁹) is taken to mean an extension
of Caesar’s ordinance to a prohibition 01 heavy traffic by night. Some day
perhaps a few modern towns will rise to that altitude of civilization.
