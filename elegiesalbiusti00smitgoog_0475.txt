70-80. Sums up all the prophecies os the Sibyls iu 67-70 (aie. ‘quid-
quid¹admonuit Amalthea, Herophile, Phyto, Albunea') as limited by the
parenthetical 71-78. Hence (67-79), ‘all the predictions os the Sibyls
(67-70) -1 mean their predictions 01 the disasters 01 the Civil Wars (71-78)
-these came 10 pass in other days now gone by.' The prayer to Apollo,
the divine patron 01 the Empire, to do away with such horrors forms the
transition to tbe next and contrasted topic, the prosperity which he is asked
to bestow upon the new regime. This gives the poet an opportunity 01 10-
turning to his favourite theme (81-104, cp. 2, 1 ; 1, 10, 39, etc), an idyllic pic-
ture 01 country life in the piping times ol peace, as illustrated by the sestal
celebration in honour of the rustic divinities.

79. haec fuerant olim: rie. previous to the new regime which at the time
01 writing had already been an accomplished fact lor some time, hence the
plupersect sueram, cp. 1, 5, 38 n. 111110 poet had been reckoning srom the
time 01 writing, suerunt (2, 3, 12 n.) would have been used. The marked
tendency os the plupersect, more esp. 01 esse, to encroach on the 0011. aud
imperi. in the 10111 speech was welcomed hythe poets 101 its metrical con·
venience and is not at all uncommon in Propertius and Ovid. Cp. eg.
Propert.1,12,11,‘nonsum ego qui sueram: mutat via longa puellas,' ie.
‘besore she went away and had a change 01 heart'; Ovid, Amor. Epig. 1,
‘qui modo Nasonis fueramus quinque libelli Ι tres sumus,' ae. previous to
the revision. So Her. 1,115; Met. 2, 570; Trist. 3,11,25,etc.; Propert.

Except lor Seneca and Vitruvius this use isvery rare 111 prose until the African .

writers. The tendency 01 the folk speech 10 confuse the three tenses 01 the
past (already seen in Vitruvius) continued to grow until by the beginning 01
the sixtb century such a writer as Fulgentius evidently had no clear idea
os the distinction between imperf, peri, and plupersect. -tur 1, 1, 33 n.

80. The universal belief in the purisying powers 01 the sea (or 01 running
water, cp. 4, 4, 8) is abundantly exemplified in a number 01 religious rites,
cp. Seneca, De Ira, 1, 15, 23 Lucan, 1, 5893 010. So even in medicine and
law (derived 01 course irom a religious conception and sometimes symbolic),
cp. ag. Homer, Iliad, 1, 313 f.; Cicero, Rosc. Am. 703 Invent. 2, 1493 Val.
Max.1,1, 13 (punishment 01 parricides). The eustom here alluded to 01
castiug prodigia into the sea was regularly resorted to in the caseos monstrous
births‚ cp. Livy, 31,12‚8; obsequens, ²²3 253 26; 27; 323 345 363 47-48;
