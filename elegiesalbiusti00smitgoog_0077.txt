TlBVLLVS

Until recent years modern critics‚ more especially the scholars ol
the Renaissance and of the seventeenth aud eighteenth centuries, iol-
lowed this estimate with such verbal literalness that in some instances
we may fairly suspect that the real meaning and application os it
was not understood. On the other hand the tendency os late
years to depreciate the worth os Tibullus occasionally supports it·
sels by impugning Quintilian’s ability to appreciate the best poetry.
In the majority os such instances we no longer suspect that he has
not been understood, we are sure ol it} The criticism of Quin-
tilian, like that os Velleius, like that os Ovid, is largely is not en-
tirely concerned with the poet's technique and form, in short
with his art. In this respect not only Quintilian, but asa rule
antique criticism in general, is asaithful reflection ol the poet’s
own attitude toward his work. His standard and the goal os his
ambitiou was perfection os form. He rarely lost sight os the·
essential unity os the plastic arts.

Judged from this point of view the superiority os 'Tibullus is
quite beyond dispute. We may grant that Ovid was capable os
surpassing Tibullus even in his own domain. Indeed after Quin·
tilian’s words on Ovid’s Medea we are sure ol it. The fact re·
mains however that he did not, and that Tibullus showed better
taste and more literary sels-control. We may grant too that Ti-
bullus did not possess the unique imagination ol Propertius. We
think however that here again he sometimes showed better taste‚
and we know that he wrote better verses. In short judged by his
own standard, which is the standard os antiquity in general, he is

Gedicht herantreten, wie die Rhetoren Velleius und Quintilian, denen jede Fahig-
keit mangelt, iiber die Komposition eines Kunstwerks zu urteilen, weil ihr eigenes

Surely Velleius and Quintilian are an ill-assorted pair to bracket as representa-
tives ol any one thing in common. And 1 arn constrained to register my protest
here that Quintilian was thoroughly acquainted with the great canons ol criticism,
that they are immutable, and that we depart from thern at our perii.
