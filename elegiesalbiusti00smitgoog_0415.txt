so strongly os some dainty Hellenistic fresco of the best period. They are,
moreover, eminently fitting here since they suggest the stillness and peace of
night as the fitting close οί a long day os innocent enjoyment.

87-88. The chariot and horses of Night are common enough both in
artaud literature, cp. Aisch. Choeph. 660; Verg. Α. ς, 7215 and osten. The
stars are the children of Night in Eurip. Elekt. 54, ὦ νὺξ μέλαινα, χρυσέων
ἄστρων τροφέ· Orphic Hymns, 7, 3, ἀστέρες οὐράνιοι, Νυκτὸς φίλα τέκνιι
relatvm etc. It is Euripides, too, who sees the stara accompanying the
c'hariot of Night (ep. Ion, 1150, μελάμπεπλος δὲ Νὺξ ἀσείρωτον mals Ι ὄχημ’
ἔτιλλεν, ἄστρα δ’ ὡμάρτει θεᾷ), and the idea reappears in Theokrit. a, 165,
χαίρετε δ’ ἄλλοι Ι ἀστέρες, είκήλοιο κατ’ ἄντογο νυκτὸς ἀτιιᾶοί. But, so far as
Ican discover, the combination ol both ideas, as in this passage, is unique.
The touch os quaint tenderness thus gained is very characteristic of our poet.
Interesting by way of comparison is the conceit of Ariosto, 0. F. 12, 68,
describing the dawn as the time when, ‘The Stars had cast their veils about
their head, Ι Departing srorn their revela in the sky!

89-90. Sleep too is usually esteemed the-son os Night (Hesiod, Theog.
212; Enrip. Kykl. 6013 Nonnos, 31, ¹¹73 eto). Mustard cites Tennyson,
T ἀι Gardaenet's Dauglrter-

Night slid down one long stream οί sighing wind,
Audin ber bosom bore the baby, Sleep.

Wings are not mentioned in connection with Sleep until the Alexandrian Age
(Kallimach. Hymn ίο Apollo, 234), but aster that time they occur regularly
in art and literature. Tibullus's description suggests a majestic figure more
or less envcloped (circumdatus) in his own great pinions. The picture is
striking and very unusual, since the wings conventionally ascribed to Sleep are
small ancl more or less suggestive· of the talaria οί Hermes, cp., too, Fronto
iubis charming allegory os the creation os Sleep (trans. by Pater iu his
Marius the Epicurean), 229 N.,‘post id luppiter alas non ut Mercurius
talares sed ut Amori humeros exaptos Somno adnexuit. non enim te solis
aut talari ornatu ad pupulas hominum et palpebras incurrere oportet curruli
strepitu et cum fremitu equestri, sed placide et clementer pinnis teneris in

modurn hirundinum advolare, non ut columbae alis plaudere ' (which suggests ·

the ἀηδονίοο ττεράνὛτνου οί Nonnos, 5, 411; etc.).

Tibullus, however, or some predecessor, leaves one with the impression
that he has added appropriate wings to the Hypnos os Hesiod, Τ heog. 762, that
majestic but gentler brother os Death, who γοῖον τε καί εὐρέι νῶτα θιιλάσσης Ι
ἥσυχος ἀνστρέφεται κοί μείλιχος ἀνθρώποισι· cp. also the Orphic Argvnamica,
1007-
