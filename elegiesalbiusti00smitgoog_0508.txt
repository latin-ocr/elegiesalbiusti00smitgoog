NOTES [4, 6, 15

7-8. 4, 5, 6 and 13-14 with notes.

9. hene compones: ale. ‘join,’ ‘match' cp. 4, 5, 13-,14 n.; Ovid, Ars
Amat. 2, 385, ‘hoc bene compositos, hoc firmos solvit amores’; Consol. ad
Liv. 301, etc—ullae . . . viro: ‘there is no maid whose service is more
meet ior him, no men ior her! Apparentlya paraphrase oi Sulpicia’s own
words in 4, 7, ro.-ullae: ior ulli. The only case in the entire literature
(Neue, 2, 520), and the one exception in the Tibullian corpus to the rule oi
·ius and -i ior words os this class. The remaining exx. in the elegy are nullae
(of which ullae non here is really the equivalent), Propert. 1, 20, 353 toto,
Propert. 3,11, 573 Ovid, Amor. 3, 3, 41.

ro. dignior: dr'gnm with the infin. is found elsewhere only in 2, 6, 43 (see
also 1, 7, 2ο n.). Never in Propertius. Frequent in Ovid.

11-12. 1, 2, 15 and 19; 1, 6, 93 2, 1, 75 and notes. Cp. also ‘dulcissima
111112,’1114,5,7,211114, 51211.

12. mille: 1, 3, 5ο n.

13. 2, 5, 7; 1, 7, 46; 4, 2,11 audoene-perlucida: te. διαφανής, ‘trans-
parent,’ which suggests ‘Coan vestments' (2, 3, 53 2.). Heyne‘ hastens to
justiiy Juno's appearance in Venus’s iavoprite costume by remarking that
‘superiniecta illa erat tunicae, plerumque etiam aliis vestimentis interioribus,’
and Nemethy comesto the rescue with perlucida = valde lucida, nitida, can·
dida, ior which he quotes Cicero, Dio. 1, 130, ‘illustris et perlucida stella’;
Mart. 12, 38, 3, ‘crine nitens, niger unguento, perlucidus ostro, 1 ore tener,

latus pectore, crure glaber.⁹ Surely, however, from the antiq'ue point of view,
Sulpicia's little Juno Natalis needs no such deience. Even the great Juno
contended ior the golden apple. Why should she flinch irom Coan vestments

on 2 iestal day?

14. ter: 1, 2, 54 n.; 1, 3, 11.-fit: facere or (impera.) fieri :sacra sa-
cere or sacrificare, with the dative of the god (expressed or understood) and
the ablative oi the offering (as here) is occasional in the literature, eg. Plau·
tus, Stich. 251; Verg. E. 3, 773 Columella, 2, 21. 11 is esp. characteristic,
however, oi sacerdotal speech, cp. such fixed phrases occurring again and
again in the Acta Fratrum Arvalium as ‘perlectoque sacrificio ornnes ture
et vino lecerunt: quae in verba lunoni'reginae bove aurata vovi esse iutu-
rum,’ eto-libo: 1, 7, 54; 2, 2, 8; 1, ιο, 23 n.

15. praecipit, etc.: r'.e. the usual suggestions oi a fond mother on such an
occasion, the point being that she is blissiully ignorant oi the lact that her
daughter has any preferences oi her own. Neither here nor elsewhere is it
implied that the mother considered Cerinthus an undesirable parti, but sim-
ply that she did not think oi him at all in that connection. Any other inter-
pretation spoils the point os the contrast between 15 and 16. See Introd.
