NOTES [2, 4, 28

important source for the legal aspect ol this crime, we have a passage from
Ulpian, De Officio proconsulis, 7, in which he says, ⁸ Sacrilegii poenam debebit
proconsul pro qualitate personae proque rei condicione et temporis'et aetatis
et sexus vel severius vel clementius statuere. et scio multos et ad bestias
damnasse sacrilegos, nonnullos etiam vivos exussisse, alios vero in furca
suspendisse. sed moderanda poena est usque ad bestiarum damnationem
eorum, qui manu iacta templum eliregerunt et dona dei in noctu tulerunt.
ceterum si qui interdiu modicum aliquid de templo tulit, poena metalli
coercendus est, aut, si honestiore loco natus sit, deportandus in insulam est.'

Widespread oi course was the popular belief that the sacrilegus was pun-
isbed by the god himself, and this is really all that Tibullus is thinking of both
here and in 1, 2, 81-82. Punishments meted out by the outraged divinity
appear to vary, eg. ‘oculis membrisque captum exspirare ’ in a case reported
by Pliny, 33, 83; a series oi misfortunes ending in assassination acc. to
Iustinus, 39, 2, 5, cp. 24, 6, 4; suicide acc. to Demosthenes, Contra Timokr.
121 (738), etc. Important references to sacrilege are, among others, Juv. 13,
147³ Arnob. 6, 2ο, Vol. Max. 1,1,18; Ail. Var. Hist. ι, 2ο.

24-26. For somewhat similar illustratione ol the nalvete ol antique belief
cp. r, 6, 3 and n.; Propert. 3, 7, 13; etc.

27 f. For this lecture on greed and extravagance with which 2, 3, 35 fiand
Propert. 3, r 3, 1-14have much in common, cp. 1, 9, 173 Propert. 1, ²3 3, 73 etc.

The greed ol women is caused by the desire lor expensive luxuries.
Expensive luxuries are illustrated by four standard examples-emeralds,
Tyrion purple, Coan vestments, and pearls. The construction ol the two
sentences is due to the lact that the poet curses the purveyor ol the first two,
then, in 29, gives his reason, and finally adds the last two as an asterthought.
Hence Coa uestis and concha as well aslaic (ia. the quicumque ol 27) are
subjecta ol dar. quicumque is the grammatical subject ol both legit an'd
tingit (hence laic), although logically the dyer ol Tyrian purple and tbe col·
lector ol jewels would be two different persons. The distinction, however, is
a matter of no consequence in this connection.

27.smaragdos:1,1,51n. Pearls (lucida concha) and emeralds were Ι

much worn inTibuilus’s time. Pliny, 9, 117, says that the emeralds and pearls
worn on ordinary occasions by the empress Lollia Paulina were worth
4o,0oo,0oo sesterces, ie. nearly 2,25o‚ooo doliars.

28. syrio murice: 2, 3, 57-58 n.-ovem: ie. ‘fleece’ The whole ior
the part or uice versa is a common device of poetry, cp. concha below, ie. the
sbell ior the pearl it contains; rota, 1, 9, 62 n. The only parallel, however,
lor ouis = laua as here is cited by Wunderlich irom Soph. Trachin. 696,
τὸ γὰρ κάταγμα . . . Ι τῆς οἰός, but the line is bracketed in modern editions,
