foreign influence show no sign of this theory nor do they ever mention the
beating ol drums, etc, in connection with their own theory of witchcrast (men-

tioned in 21-22 n). 'lhe use os drums as a countercharm to the eclipse con·
‚ sidered as due to witchcrat‘t seems to be confined to the Romans or to the
Greek writers ol the Empire (Ovid, Met. 7, 2073 Med. Fac.4r; Sen. Med. 795;
Mart. 12, 57, 163 Juv. 6, 442, etc. down to eg. Sisebutus in the seventh
century, Anu. Lat. 483, 18R.). Perhaps the practice of drums, whichcertainly
belonged lrom the first with the theory of the eclipse as due to a devouring
monster, was asterward transferred to the more local theory ol' the eclipse ss
due to witchcrat't. For other res. to drums in this connection see eg. Livy,

2⁶. sed femori conseruisse femur: in discussing the declension ofsemur,
Charisius, p. 87 K.. says, ‘ hoc lemur, huius femoris, sed frequenter huius lerninis
huic semini dictum <est et) pluraliter tam femina quam femora, ideoque (et
Tib)ullus hoc ipsum erudite custodit curn dicit implicuitque femur femini!
Cp. p. 1 30, ‘semini Tibullus, implicuit (que) femur sennim, non femori qrrnsi sit
hocfemnrhuiuslemoris! ll' Charisiushad ourline inmind it followseither, that
his memory was surprisingly bad or else, that his text was surprisingly different
from ours. ll' he did not have it in mind he was either quoting from some
elegy ol' Tibullus now lost to us, or he had mixed his references and substituted
‘Tibullus' lor the name ot' some other poet whom it is no longer possible to
identily. This last seems to be the mostreasonable solution os the problem and
itis now generally accepted.
