33. celebrare: ‘often approach‚’ ie. ‘may it be my lot to return home and
live long to enjoy it,’ cp. 1, 6, 17 n.

34. For this sacrifice cp. eg. Cato, De Agri Cute 143, 2, ‘kalendis idibus,
nonis, festus dies curn erit, coronam in focum indat, per eosdemque dies Lari
familiari pro copia supplicet’ ; Propert. 4, 3, 53, ‘ omnia surda tacent, rarisque
assueta kalendis Ι vix aperit clausos una puella Lares,' etc. The Lares were thus
honoured (with tura, serta, uva, vinum, etc. -‘pro copia,’ as Cato says) not
only on regular days and feast days as mentioned above, but on special family
occasions such as births, marriages, whe'u some member of the family lest or
returned home, upon moving into a new house, attainment of majority, death,
ete-reddere : for which the simple dare sometimes occurs, is regularly used
of ollerings to the gods (cp. Verg. E. 5, 75, eta), so in Greek ἀποδιδόναι,
ie. ‘we return thanlrs,’ ‘reddimus quia debentur' (Servius on Verg. G. 2,
194), cp. ‘render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.’—reddereque:
a dactylic infinitive with que preventing elision appears to be very rare. Ι have
noted no other case in Tib.. Propertius, or the Carmina Amatoria of Ovid.
Other dactylic words so used are 1, 6, 483 1, ro, 26, 4, 3, 103 Lygd.3,
2, 10; Propertius, 25 exx.; Ovid, Carm. Amat. 24 exx.

35·4⁸· The Golden Age (cp. 1, ιο, 1 ; a, 3, 71 ; esp. Ovid, Amor. 3, 8, 35)
was a favourite theme of antique literature. It isthe antithesis of present dis·
comfort, the vision of unfulfilled desire reflected on the screen of the past. As
such the description of it, though remarkably conservative, varies with the
times, the department, and the setting of 'the episode. The earliest and most

’ famous versionis Hesiod, Works and Days, 109 ff. The idea was much

developed and elaborated by the Mystics of the sixth century tac, and again,
at the second revival of Mysticism before and during Vergil's time (Orphic,
Sibylline, and magio books, etc.). Not only poets (Theognis, 1135, poets of
the Old comedy such as Kratinos and Teleklides, esp. Aratos, 105, etc.) develop
the theme, but historiens and romancers (Dikaiarehos F. H. G. v'ol. 11, p. 2333
Dionys. Hal. 1, 3⁶3 Diod. Sic. 5, 66, etc.) and esp. philosophers (Empedokles,
128, Diels ; Plato, Palit. 271 E ; Posidonius, in Seneca, Epist. 90, etc.) who use it
asan exponent of their ideals and theories. On the Roman side some of the
most notable references to the Golden Age or to its analogues in this world or
the next (the Hyperboreans‚ Elysium, the Isles of the Blest, etc.) are Vergil,

E. 4, 9; G. 1,115; 2, 538; Hor.Epod16,41; Ovid, Met. 1, 89 3 15, 96; ,

Seneca, Phaedra, 525 ; Medea, 309 ; Octavia, 395 ς Juvenal, 6, 1 ; Claudian,
In Rufi 1, 38ο; De Rapa Pras. 3, 19;Ι Boethius, Cons. Phil. 2, met. 53 etc.

Lucretius, 5, 925 ff., a famous passage often imitated by later writers, is the ,

most important presentation of the opposlng view'of those evolationists of 1
antiquity, the Epicureans. For a more extensive discussion see my ‘Ages ol ]
