sine voce loquentia dicam: Ι verba leges digitis, verba notata mer0’3 2, 5,
173 Ars Amat. 1, 500³ 571; Her. 17, 87 (Helen to Paris), ‘orbe quoque in
mensae legi sub nomine nostro, Ι quod deducta mero littera fecit: ‘t amo.'’ Ι
credere me tamen hoc oculo renuente negavi, Ι ei mihi, iam didici sic ego
posse loqut’ Cp. also 1, to, 31-32 n.

22-22. On this and other stock excuses for leaving horne cp. Ars Amat. 3,
633, ‘quid faciat custos cum sint totnin urbe theatra, Ι cum spectet iunctos illa
libenter equos, Ι cum sedeat Phariae sistris operata iuvencae, Ι quoque sui
comites ire vetantur eat, Ι cum fuget a templis oculos Bona Diva virorum Ι
praeterquam siquos illa venire iubet, Ι eum custode foris tunicas servante puel·
lae Ι celent furtivos balnea multa iocos’; Martial, ιι, 7; Lukian, Amor.
’ 423 ‘In my conscience she went forth with no dishonest intent z for she did
not pretend going to any sermon in the further end of the city,’ etc. (Bean-
mont and Fletcher, The Woman Hater, 2, r).

ar. seu: ‘even it' F or this use of seu without a correlative cp. 2, 4, 433
Propert. 2, 26, 29; Catull. 82, 43 Seneca, Herc. Oet. 1260; Val. Flacc. 1,101,
etc. In such exx. seu or sive preserves vein its old sense of que or et and
hence :et sr'. The form sive does not occur in Tibullus. Propertius, on
the contrary, uses one form as often as the other. As with seu and sive,
however, so with other words which exist in two different forms, it is more
or less characteristic of Tibullus to choose one and exclude the other. neu,
for instance, occurs twelve times, neve, but once (linc 18 above, see Lease, .
Class. philol. 3, 3ο2); atque, eleven times, ac (a prosaic form), but three
times (1, 3, 633 1, 5, 72; 2, 5, 87); neque, in 1, 2, 77, elsewhere always nec
whether before vowels or consonants, ex virgis, 2, 1, 24, elsewhere always
e and a before consonants, ex and ab before vowels; circum, five times, circa
(rare in Cicero, never in Caesar), twice (1, 3, 87; r, 7, 56); tum, eleven
times, tunc, twenty-six times. So always sic for ita ,· nam for enirm quod
for quia (except 1, 4, 13); quamvis for quamquam, etc. There is also a
tendency to exclude exceptional usage in gendes and declensional forms; to
reject diminutives, pet-names, and other words or uses of words· suggestive
of the popular speech. In general, these and similar phenomena serve to
illustrate the aelf-evident fact that Tibullus wasa purist, a fastidious man of
cultivated taste. In particular, they lend considerable support to Btirger's
contentiori that Tibullus belonged to the Analogists, that school of stylistic
theotists of which Julius Caesar was the greatest representative in prose. See
esp. R. Biirger, Ber'trdge aur Elegantia Tibulls, ιΧάριτες, Friedrich Leo, zum
secbzigsten Geburtstag dargebracht,’ Berlin, 1911, 371-394·

Burger’s method, however, of removing much of the exceptional usage
which contravenes his theory by emendation does not commend itself.
