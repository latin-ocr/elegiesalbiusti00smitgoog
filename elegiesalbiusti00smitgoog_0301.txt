the Italian harvest time, and of course desirable 111 this connection, cp. Verg.

G. r, 298.

23-24. 1,1,10n.; 1, 7, 353 2,1,45. For more detailed descriptions of
the process, Cato, 1203 Columella, 12, 19.

24. candida musta: for the adjective cp. Pliny 23, 29, ‘musta differen-
tias habent naturales has, quod sunt candida aut nigra aut inter utrum'que,
alia ex quibus viuum fiat, alia ex quibus passum!

’ 25-34. Note themarked use of the poet’s favourite figure of anaphora 111
this passage (1, 1, 23 11.). Further liveliness is insured by frequent demon·
stratives which enforce again and again the supreme importance of Delia and
incidentally of Messalla in this dream of idyllic happiness. ,

27. deo agricolae: 1, r, 14 n.

The personal dative with verbs of motion (trans. or intrans.) is frequent in
the poets. It is sometimes an indirect object, occasionally even suggests the
object for which, more often some category under the dative of personal inter·
est. Τ115 relation is usually indicated by ⁴ for’ rather than.¹ to.’

With venire, 1, 1, 59; 1, 3, 65; 2, 4, 43; 1, 9, 433 1, ιο, 67, but 2, 5, 46,
‘ad Troianos’ ln one ex, 2, 1, 81, ‘veni dapibus festis,’ the dative is not per·
souul but rather a dativus commodi. With mittere, 2, 6, 373 4,13,13; por·
tare, 2, 2, 18; serre, as here, 2, 6, 31.

28. pro segete spicas: acc. to L. Mtiller this and 1, 6, 34 are the only

' exx. in the elegy oi the lengthening of a short final vowel before two conso·

nants in the following word. Not uncommon in Vergil, cp. G. 1, 153; 164;
352; 3713 etc. The vowel is usually as here in the thesis.

29-30. Emphatic summary suggested by the particulata previously men·
tioned. Note cunctos, omnio, tota, for Delia as opposed to nihil for himself.
Martial, 14, 193, writing verses to go with acopy of Tibullus 1ο be given at
a dinner party (apophoretum) ‘ussit amatorem Nemesis lasciva Tibullum, j in
tota iuvit quem nihil esse domo! As Nemesis was a later love Martial is per-
haps slyly commenting upon the poet’s inconstancy by associating with her
a line which, as he and many of his readers must bave known, belonged to
Delia. This seems more likely than to suppose that he confused the two.
So Ovid, Amor. 3, 9 (on the death of Tib.) 57, ‘cui Nemesis ‘¹ quid ” ait “tibi
suut mea damna dolori? j me tenuit moriens deficiente manu,”’ gives 1ο
Nemesis a line written for Delia (1, 1, 60).

29. For the shift from future indicative to subjunctive (sciet . . . regat, etet
see 1, 1, 24 n.—illi sint curae: the double dative is on the whole a popular
construction. Tib. uses it only here and 2, 3, 43 (also with curae), cp. Sul-
pieia, 4, 7,2; 4, ro, 5, otherwise as in 1, 9,51; 2, 3, 313 4,12, 1. ForPro
pertius Hoerle cites only 2, 26, 31; 2, 15, 273 4, 11, 29; 2, 5, 3o; 2,26,17.
