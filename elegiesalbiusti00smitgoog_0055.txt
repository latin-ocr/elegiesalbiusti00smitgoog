TIBVLLVS

At any rate the Delia of the fisth elegy has sadly deteriorated
since we saw her last. Nor does the poet himself appear in an
enviable light. She has degenerated to a mere courtesan; he
is the slave of a now ignoble passion, and is quite willing to
be received upon her own terms. He still follows his charac-
teristic method of reproof indirectly by means of parables, but
for once the old tenderness rings false, and the appearance for
the first time of such a brotal phrase as

ianua sed plena est percutienda manu

is not only a sufficient indication of the change that has occurred,
but leaves us fully prepared for the deliberate mockery, ,the

flippant cynicism, of the next elegy.

The fourth, eighth, and ninth elegies of the first book are
concerned with one Marathus a puer delicatus, ostensibly be-
longing to the poet. The boy's name is never mentioned by
¹ Ovid nor by any succeeding writer, and it is likely that he is no

- more real than those fair and fragile Hellenic damsels of
syllabled air that smile or frown upon us from the pages of
Horace. We must not forget however that the vices of the
Greeks had the same attraction for the Romam, especially for
the cruder type, that the lower life of Paris seems to have for so
many Americans. ,

The arrangement, as with the elegies to Delia, is chronological
in the artistic sense, and each is a separate entity. They are
among the most successful of the -many well-written poems which
the Alexandrian Greeks and some of their Roman imitators chose
to waste ¹upon a theme peculiarly repulsive to modern taste.

The fourth,a sort of general introduction to the series, might ’
be called ‘Priapus de arte amandi.¹ As such it is the most im-
portant forerunner now existing of Ovid’s Ars Amaton'a, written
some 25 or 30 years later.

The setting of the piece is found in more than one repre-
sentation which has actually survived from antiquity—a garden
