TIBVLLVS

poet’s chosen field ; the circle of Maecenas was apparently
less so. It may be worth noting too that in the one group
he could he, and was, the greatest man, but that in the
other he was surpassed by at least two-the freedman’s son
from Venusia, and the farmer's boy from beyond the Ρο.
Tibullus was generous and well balanced; but after all he was
also human, and doubtless possessed his share of the artistic

temperament. He can hardly have sympathized fully with the
perfervid admiration that greeted the appearance of the first
book of Propertius and after his rival had been talren up by
Maecenas he might be pardoned for finding the official circle
less congenial.

The opinion that Tibullus cared nothing for literary fame ln
the ordinary sense seems to be based largely upon a passage
in the second book (a, 4, 13-20, where see note), in which
being nearly distracted by his mistress, he exclaims in despair-

ad dominam faciles aditus per carmina quaeror

ite procul, Musae, si nihil ista valent.

Itis a question whether any contemporary reader was ever de·
ceived by this statement. The attitude, as we have already seen
(p. 29), represents a time-honoured convention of the elegy, and
how much of a mere convention it really is may be seen from the
fact that it rests upon the quite incredible assumption that poetry
is actually able to win a woman belonging to the sphere within
which he and his elegiae confreres were supposed to confine
their allections. Tibullus was certainly enough a man of the
world to know that in that sphere his verses were a negligible
quantity as compared with his good loolrs, his neat appearance,
but, above all, his comfortable income. At all events if he
was not aware of the¹ fact, it was not for laclr of experience.
To judge from his elegies as they stand, his chief occupation
during the last ten or fifteen years of his life was-
