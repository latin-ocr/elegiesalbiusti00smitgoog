NOTES [1, 9, 61

to ridere in this sense does not seem 1ο ocem elsewhere. The analogy is
such expressions as Terence, Andria, 583, ‘dolis ut me deluderes' (quoted
as ‘deridere dolis' by Wunderlich ad. loc. and afterwards by Dissen and
Nemethy). As developed by Tibullus the expression becomes a work of art
in the way of insult, ‘May she make you her laughing stock, may she rejoice
in making you contemptible, with her unceasing intrigues—-and never fare
the worse 101 11.’ The implication is that an utter contempt for him shall be
one 01 ber leading motives for infidelity-a touch of genuine human natu-re.

55-56. Priapea, 47, ‘quicunque vestrum qui venitis ad cenam, Ι libare nullos
sustinet mihi versus, Ι illius uxor aut amica rivalem Ι lasciviendo languidum,
precor, reddat, Ι 01 ipse longa nocte dormiat solus Ι libidinosis incitatus erucis.¹

55. usu: aie. ‘Veneris usu,' cp. Ovid, Amor. 3, 7, 3 and 495 Rem. Amor.
3 73 ete.

556. Propert. 3, 21, 8, ‘vix tamen aut semel admittit, cum saepe negarit: Ι
seu venit, extremo dormit amicta 1010 ’; 2, 15, 6; Lulrian, Dial. Mer. 11, 45
Hor. Epod 3, 22, etc.

57. externa vestigia, etc: Livy, 1, 58, 7 (possibly an echo of this pas·
sage, acc. to Stacey), ‘vestigia viri alieni, Collatiae, in lecto sunt tuo’;
Propert. 2, 9, 45; 2, 29, 353 Ovid, Amor. 1, 8, 97; Cicero, Verr. 3, 34, 79; etc.

58. pateat semper aperta: ‘may your house be always open and acces·
sible.' semper goes with aperta, but really qualifies the complex. — cupidis:
i.e. amatoribus,so 1, 8, 563 etc.

59. The reference to strong drink in this connectionis especially insulting
because it at once puts tbe man's sister in the class with the lenae, sagae, and
meretrices, and at the same time suggests that she is no longer young. The
fondness 01 old women of this type for drink is constantly being mentioned,
cp. Propertq, 5, 2; Ovid, Amor. 1, 8, '13 Hor. Od. 1, 36, 13, Plautus,
Cure. 96-126; Anah. Pal. 7, 329; 353; etc.

60. emeruisse: ironical euphemiam, ie. ‘bene meruisse de,’ ‘bene fecisse,’
so always when amem takes an accus. of the person after the analogy of
dentereo (rare; beside this ex. Harper quotes only Ovid, Trist. 4, 8, 523
Amor. 2, 8, 24; Her. 6, 138).

61-64. Α 10-012101110111, with rhetorical amplification, of the preceding dis·
tich, 61-62 01 the hexameter (59), 63-64 of the pentameter (60).

61-62. The touch of high poetry seen in the circumlocution 101 the dawn is
01 course satiric. So Ovid, Amor. 1, 8, 3 (01 Dipsas the lena), ‘ex re nomen
habet: nigri non illa parentem Ι Memnonis in roseis sobria vidit equis! For
the motive cp. Maniai, 1, 28, ‘hesterno faetere mero qui credit Acerram Ι falli·
tur: in lucem semper Acerra bibit.’

61. convivia ducere: ie. ι0011110110, keep up her revrls’ The accessory
