NUFES [2, 3, 59

56. On this antique idea that the heat ol the tropics is due to an increased
proximity ol the sun, and therefore that the larther we go, the hotter it grows,
cp. eg. Hor. od. 1, 22, 21, ‘pone sub curru nimium propinqui Ι solis, in terra
domibus negata’; Seneca, Oed. 121, ‘prornit hinc ortus aperitque lucem}
Phoebus et flamma propiore nudos l inficit Indos’; Thyest. 602, ‘Medus et
Phoebi propioris ludus '3 Macrob. Somn. Scap. 2, 10, ιι, ‘ Aethiopes¹ . . . quos
vicinia solis usque ad speciem nigri coloris exurit,’ but esp. Vergil's description
of the five zones, G. 1, 231 l.

57-58. For an interesting enumeration and discussion of the colours worn
by women iu the time ol Tibullus, see Ovid, Ars Amat. 3, 169 f. The brilliant
colours, such as those mentioued here, were more or less characteristic ol
women like Nemesis. In the second century, for example, Artemidorus, the
interpreter ol dreams, says (2, 3) that γυναικὶ δὲ ποικίλη καὶ ἀνθηρὰ ἐσθὴς
συμφέρει, μάλιστα δὲ ἑταίρᾳ καὶ πλουσίᾳ.

ΤΙιο shades ol purple (a colour much used in antiquity) varied from scarlet
to deep violet. Tne purpureum or purple proper (ae. the deep violet) was
made by the 'l'yrians as here stated, aud lrom the murex. puniceum or scar-
let is said to besupplied by Africa because it was manufactured by the Car·
thaginians3 it is called puniceum or Punic because Carthage was a Phoenician
colony. lt was made from cochineal extracted, not lrorn nopal, which was

first discovered long afterward in Mexico, but from the berries (coccum,
κόκκος, Arab. hermes) of the scarlet oalr (Pliny, 22,3 h). Since the discovery

ol' aniliue dyes the great industries ol Tyre and her daughter have ceased
to have anything but an historical interest.

57. cenent praebere: certare with the infinitive begins with Lucretius
and remains a poetical construction.

58. For the chiasmus, see 1, 1, 43 n. The lacuna between 58 and 59 may
have contained or may have closed with some variant ol the statemeots made
in 35 or 49. At least this would form a logical transition to 59-60.

59. regnum tenet: 1, 9, 80 n. - ipse: ‘the very man whom,' etc.
-quem . . . pedes: this sneer at the dives amator is conventional though
olten enough no doubt well founded, cp. Propert. 4, 5, 51 (advice of the leuato
her charge), ‘nec tibi displiceat milesnon sactus amori, l nauta nec attrita si serat
aeramanu, Ι aut quorum titulus per barbara colla pependit, 1 caelati medio cum
saluere foro’ ; Ovid, Amor. 1, 8, 63‚⁴ uec tu, si quis erit capitis mercede redemptus,
Ι despice: gypsati crimen inane pedis ’; cp. Ars Amat. 2, 275, ‘carmina lau-
dantur sed munera magna petuntur: 1 dummodo sit dives, barbarus ipse placet,'
etc. He is a barbarian and hasbeen a slave (barbara catasta,· gypsati pedes).
Moreover, even as a slave he was inferior and a bad investment, otherwise he
would not have been put up lor sale so osten (saepe) and so publicly.
