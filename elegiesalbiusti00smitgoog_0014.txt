PREFACE

oi the Notes will be sufficiently clear to any one who has
read the Introduction. A recital oi my aims and endeav-
ours, an account of my preparation for this work, would

be merely stating in¹ another form what Ι conceive to be

the plain duty of any commentator who deserves the name.

Ι shall be content ii scholars whose opinion Ι value shall
accord me the credit oi an honest effort to perform that
duty to the best ol my ability.

In its original form the Appendix contained a lull appa-
ratus cn'ticus, two or three notes on technical matters, and
a complete list oi authorities consulted. Upon second
thoughts it seemed advisable to withbold all this material
Ἴ from a book already in danger of becoming overgrown.
Moreover, the loss is largely‚ if not entirely, compensated
by the lact that the principal authorities or the sources
from which they may be derived are now mentioned in th‘e
Notes or in the footnotes of the Introduction. So, too,
the essential details oi textual ,tradition have already been
discussed, and the minutiae of the complete record are
easilyaccessible in the excellent critical editions oi Hiller
and Postgate.

· Ι was iorced to prepare the Index even for my own use.
I may assume therefore that it will be useful to others.
Ι had thought oi entering here the imitations and reminis·
cences oi Tibullus gleaned from the later Roman poets by
various editors and special investigators. The majority oi
these however are too vague to be conclusive. I have
recorded therefore only those which are mentioned in the
Notes.

, This book hasbeen enriched by the helpful suggestions,
and I myself have been upheld by the genuine interest, of
more than one friend whose name is not recorded here.
