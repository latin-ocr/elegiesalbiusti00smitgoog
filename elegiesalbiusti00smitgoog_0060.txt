money, money! Begone then, ye Muses, since ye cannot help a
lover! Gists she demands and gilts Ι must get or see her no

The man is the slave os a degrading passion lor an utterly un·
worthy object, and is keenly alive to the fact. In this respect the
piece is a striking parallel to the 76th of Catullus. Catullus how·
ever is struggling tiercely with his obsession‚ and though he him-
self despairs we feel that his youth and courage are going to win
the day. Not so Tibullus. The tragedy of Tibullus is the
tragedy oi the used-up man who has no hope and has ceased to
struggle. As apicture of this depressingly pathological situation
the elegy has few equals.

Was all this purely literary, or does the poet's persistent harping
on one note have something to do with his own condition at the
time? It is of course impossible to decide. Tibullus deals by
preference with traditional motives‚ we know almost nothing of
the models he may have had before him ; nor must we lose sight

of the fact, constantly attested by every great playwright, that an,
author so wonderfully endowed with the dramatic instinct as was
Tibullus knows how to assume any character and to present it to
the life. Agaiu as we compare and combine the several groups

of elegies to Delia, Marathus, and Nemesis, all different types, we
are tempted to conclude that, whatever his personal experience
may have been, the poet's plan, from the first, was to work out
methodically all the standard literary aspects of his department
and to rest his plea for farne on acomplete cycle of the Erotic
elegy ὰ la mode Alexandrr'enne.

In such a programme personal experieuce cannot be expected
to occupy a prominent place, and in lact it has been stated more
than once that the testimony of these elegies is quite at variance
with the poet's character and tastes as described by Horace in his
epistle (1, 4). Note however that the keen-eyed Horace does
