TIBVLLVS

master his poetry has ever failed to recognize his remarkable
genius.¹

Tibullus again belongs toan entirely different type. Astand-
ard example of the ‘low relief’ of antique literary art, his most
notable quality is perfect 'simplicity. He is simplex munditiis, a
genuine representative, as Plessis has observed, of the Attic
school. As such his taste is simple to the point of severity.
There is no apparent effort to impress the reader with his own
ability. He is not a man of brilliant passages, he fumishes practi-
cally uo quotations for lovers of the striking or sententious, he
makes no attempt even to depart from the traditional themes and
motives of the elegy. So too there is uo elaborate use of mytho-
logical lore, no deep and recondite learning, uo signs of the close
’ and-fervid study of specific literarymndels His diction, though
⁶ famous—for its beauty and delicacy, is always simple; and the de-
velopment of his thought, though artistic to the last degree, gives
vno hint of formality or premeditation. His style is notably sane
and sober ; indeed as Sellar observes, ‘the active power of his
imaginationis perceptible ratherio the collocation of his words
than in figures of speech' (tle. metaphora). Finally his metrical
technique, dainty aud artistic to the point of a proverb, neverthe-
less shuns the invariable application of certain less important
rules, as condueive to monotony and in itself savouring of affecta·
tion. ln other words, thought and form are in perfect harmony
andare a faithful reflection in every particular of the Tibullian
standard of naturalness and simplicity.

Of course his simplicity is not artless. No competent critic in
these days, certainly no classical scholar worthy of the name,
needs to be reminded that ina literary masterpiece simplicity is ,

t always deliberate and naivete always artistic. Tibullus is a cou-
r sciousartist.

It would appear too that, apart from the natural bent of his
