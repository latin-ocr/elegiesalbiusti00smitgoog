TIBVLLVS

Alexander the Aetolian, the first great representative in this period
· ol the elegy as a vehicle for love stories (in his Ἀπόλλων) and —

aster the type oi Kritias—sor literary gossip (in his Μοῦσαι).
The growth of narrative elegy was encouraged not a little by the
sact that both the poets and their readers were more interested in
the legends and tales os the people than in the well-worn heroic
myths. For such tales the traditional atmosphere ol the elegy was
better suited than that ol the epic. According to the rules os the
new school the story should be told briefly. Only the most effec-
tive incidente — for example the catastrophe-were worked out in
detail, and as a matter oi course the Romantic mood was em·
phasized. A good exampleon the Roman side is the exquisite
Tarpeia elegy os Propertius (4, 4). The one long fragment ol
Alexander's Ἀπόλλων is a genuine novella oi the Milesian type.
The style is simple and straightlorward.

Τὴε many points of contact between the Roman elegy and the
New comedy, the mimo, and Herondas suggest that one of the
Hellenistic contributions to our department was a type ol elegy
animated bya certain amount of the satiric and realistic spirit.
This however is by no means certain. Moreover the Alexan-
drian poets generally prefer the epigram for the expression os this
mood. For example the instructions os the lena to her charge,
a stoclv theme in the Roman elegy -and as such the ancestor of
countless Renaissance productions like the Rettorica delle Ptvttane
os Pallavicino— are probably rhetorical expansions of such epigrams
belonging to the Hellenistic period.1 Even yet there was no real
distinction between the elegy and the epigram iu distichs.

.We now corne to Kallimachos ol Kyrene (310-240? no),
the most voluminous writer perhaps os all antiquity‚ the great rep-
resentative ol Alexandrian poetry‚ and according to later critics
the master of the elegy. His commanding position is partly due to

1Crusius, I.c. 5, p. 2283 and rel.; A. L. Wheeler‚ ‘Erotio Teaching in Roman
Elegy and the Greek Sources‚' Class philol. 5, pp. 447 f. llere too, especially. the

direct influence os the νέα is to be suspected.
