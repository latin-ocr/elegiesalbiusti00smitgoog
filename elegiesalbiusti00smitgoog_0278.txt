NOTES [1, 4, 29

28. A natural and a favourite illustration in this connection, cp. Seneca,
Herc. Fur. 178; Hor. Od. 4, 7, 7; Mimnerm. 2, 7 ; etc-stat remeatque:
lit. ‘come to a stand and return,’ cp. Hor. od. 3, 28, 6, ‘inclinare meridiem Ι
sentis ac, veluti stet volucris dies’; Seneca, phaed. 315 (ol Alkmena’s three
nights in one), ¹ nec suum tempus tenuere noctes, Ι et dies tardo remeavit ortu!

The sun pauses when he reaches the Garden ol the Hesperides at nightfall
(the day is done), then returns to be at the place ol beginning at dawn (the

night is over), cp. 2, 5, 6011. We generally say, using a different figure, ‘how
quiclrly the days come aud gol' For still another, cp. Hor. on 2, 18, 15,
‘truditur dies dle '; Ammianus in Antia. Pal. 11, 13, ἠὼς ἐξ ἠοῦς παραπέμπεται, .
elr', ἀμελούντων Ι ἡμῶν, ἐξαίφνης ἥξει d πορφύρεος, etc. - (lies = sol, as osten.
Hence the sing, cp. too the verbs.

29-30. Exx. lrom this sphere are abundant in this connection and begin as
early as Homer, Il. 6, ¹4⁶5 21, 4643 cp. Simon. 69 Crus.: Mimnerm. 2,
1 Crus.; Theokrit'23, 283 27, 103 Mosch.3,99; Rufin. Ante. Pal. 5, 74;
Aristainet. 2, 1, 43 Nemes. 4, 213 Ovid, Ars Am'at. 2, 1135 Seneca,
Phara 761 ; Propert. 4, 5, 59; Pliny, 21, 2; Anth. Pal. 12, 234; 29; 32: ιι,
53; 36ς 374ς Antk. ἰοί· 646 R·

29. ΤῙις flowers soon sade and pass away. With this method ol expressing
the idea, cp. ¹3, 5, 43 Culex, 70, ‘florida curn tellus gemmantis picta per
herhas Ι vere notat dulci distincta coloribus arva’; Propert. 1, 2, 9, ‘aspice
quos summittat humus formosa colores’; Catull. 64, 90, ‘aurave distinctos
educit vernae colores ’3 Ι Dirae, 21, 'hinc Veneris vario florentia serta decore, Ι
purpureo campos quae pingit verna colore,’ etc.

Note that Tibullus’s phrase here is purposely so constructed as to fumish a κ

close and suggestive parallel with the freshness aud colour ol youth; hence the
suppression ot' flowers iu so many words and the substitution οῖ’ colores which
suggests both flowers and youth, the use of deperdit which personifies terra
and finally the choice of the word purpureos which here as olten connotes, as
does its Greek original, brightness and beauty rather than any definite colour,
and so used isa word constantly associated with youth aud beauty. So in
English, ‘rosy’ and ⁴ roseate,’ cp. aymus ‘ Oh Love! young Love! bound iu
thy rosy band,’ ior which might be cited Val. Flacc. 8, 257, ‘ipsi inter medie,
rosea radiante iuventa) Indeed, Gray’s 'The bloom of young Desire and
purple light ol Love’ was an avowed classicism lor which he himself quoted
Phrynichos. ¹ Α

Α characteristically rhetorical development of the Tibullian comparison in
this connection is Arislaln'et. '2, 1, ’γυνὴ ἔοικε λειμῶνι, καὶ ὅπερ ἐκείνῳ τὰ ἄνθη,
τοῦτό γε ταύτῃ τὸ κάλλος. τέως μὶν οὖν ὴ κόμη (cp. comas lu l. 30) τῷ
λειμώνι ἐπακμάζει καὶ ὴ χροιᾶ τῶν ἀνθέων, ἣρος δὲ παρακμάσαντος πέπαυται
