not only oi the rustic housewife but also oi the lady of position and refinement
in both Greece and Rome. As the revellers found Lucretia, so Hector had
found Helen, Il. 6, 323; cp. Plautus, Men. 797, Verg. G. 1, 292 and 390, 4
334, esp. in the elegy, Propert. l.c.; Ovid, Met. 4, 34. The garments ol

83. casu: a'.e. faithful, ¹so 1, 6, 75, Propert. 3, 12, 25 and often.

84. matos: prototype oi the Spanish dnenna and a couventional figure of
erotic poetry3 cp. Anat. Pal. 5, 262, 289, 294, etc. Olteu she is the nutris,
which in antiquity was a lise position. As such she was the natural confidante,
aider, and abettor ol her foster daughter's love aiiair, cp. the story os Phaedra
(Eurip. and Seneca) and ol Myrrha (Ovid, Met. 20, 382) in which it is she
who precipitates the catastrophe. Hence no dives amator would think of
selecting the nutrix sor this position. With the scene suggested by this line,
cp. Ovid, Her. 19, 252, Propert. 4, 3, 42,-0082212 anus: not necessarily
Delia’s mother whom the poet eulogizes in 1, 6, 57, much less the lena of

antiquity as it was in the days of the troubadours aud trouveres, cp. Verg. G.

favourite tolk tales ol antiquity, such familiar types lor example as Persius
alludes to in 2, 37, ‘hunc optent generum rex et regina, puellae Ι hunc
rapiant3 quidquid calcaverit hic rosa fiat' Among famous exx. still surviv-
ing may he mentioned the story ol the werewolf in Petronius and ol Cupid
aud Psyche in Apuleius. The average opinion orthem is perhaps well repre-
sented by Quintil. 1, 8, 29, 2, 9, 2, cp. Tacitus, Dial. 29.-positaque
lucerna: the words have been used to prove that it was now autumn, when
the days were growing short-posita: so Ovid, Her. 29, 24 and 1513 Juv.
1, 90,etc. Sometimes apposita asin Propert. 2, 15, 3, Tac. Ann. 2, 32, etc.

expected to become sleepy early in the eveuing.
