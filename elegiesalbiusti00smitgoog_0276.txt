as. The reference is to the story of Jupiter and lo accounting for the
origin of the Ἀφροδίσιος ὅρκος. It was first told in the Arffimios attributed
to Hesiod, cp. Rzach's Hesiod, frag. 187 with ref. Apollod. 2, 1,¹ 5 in his
outline of Hesiod's version says that Zeus was surprised with lo by Hera.
Whereupon he instantly turned the girl into a white helsen ἀπωμόσατο δὲ
ταύτῃ μὴ συνελθεῖν. Tberefore, as Hesiod himself says, ἐκ τοῦ δ’ ὅρκον ἔθηκεν
drolvqrov ἀνθρώποισι Ι νοσφιδίων ἔργων πέρι Κύπριδος. Ovid, ArsAmat. Ι, 631,
imitating Tib, refers to the same story, ‘nec timide promitte: trahunt pro·
missa puellas: Ι pollicito testes quoslibet adde deos. J Iuppiter ex alto periuria
ridet amantum J et iubet Aeolios inrita ferre Notos. J per Styga Iunoni falsum
iurare solebat Ι Iuppiter: exemplo nunc favet ipse suo!

²4· iurasset: for a future perf. indic, i.e. strictly anterior to valere after
vetuit-cupide: ale. in the beat of passion. -lneptus amor: the folly of
lovers is-os course a proverb cp. Publil. Syr. 22, ‘amare et sapere vix deo
conceditur’; Plaut. Merc. 381; Catuli. 8, 1; 64, 143; etc. Indeed lovers
(cp. 1, 2, 27·28; 4, 4, 15 and notes),like lunatics, prophets, and poets (2, 5,
113-114 n), are all inspired and therefore not responsible. Here thenis the
real foundation of the old fulls-belief that lovers' oatha are not registered
above.

25-26. Diana and Minerva are selected here for emphasis, ie. they of all
the deities in the pantheon would have no inclinatior to pardon the sins of a
lover.

Swearing by the attributes of the gods instead of by the gods themselves
was regular and characteristic, esp. among the people, cp. Juv. 13, 78, where
the perjurer doth protest too much, fper Solis radios Tarpeiaque fulmina
iurat Ι et Martis frameam et Cirrhaei spicula vatis, Ι per calamos venatricis
pharetramque puellae Ι perque tuum, pater Aegaei Neptune, tridentem, Ι addit
et Herculeos arcus hastamque Minervae, Ι quidquid habent telorum armamen-

taria caeli. Ι si vero et pater est, “ comedam '’ inquit “flebile nati Ι sinciput Ι

elixi Pharioque madentis aceto”’; Ovid, Amor. 3, 3, 273 Hor. Od. 2, 8, 83
Anah. lat. 199, 11 R; etc. See also, 2, 6, 29 n. Quite the same was the
mediaeval habit which still survives in Catholic countries‚ of swearing hythe
relies or attributes of the saints, by the parts of the body of Christ, or by
whatever pertained to his cross or passion.

Oaths may be general, eg. ‘per lovem’ = ‘if 1 forswear myself let Jove
punish me accordingly,’ or specihc, ag. ‘per Iovis fulmina’ = ‘ifl forswear
myself let Jove strike me with his thunderbolt,’ ‘per Dictynnae sagittas’ =
‘Diana with her arrows' (naturally‚a woman’s oath but not necessarily),
etc. In an oath taken in the name ofa mortal the penalty is paid by the
person adjured and in the part or after tbe manner specihed (the god who
