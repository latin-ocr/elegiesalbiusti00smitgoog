his vanity and his foppishness, has been reduced to a foun-
tain of tears. As Tibullus contemplates the pair there is a
decided twinkle in his eye. In fact it would be hard to find
a poem in which real kindliness and the thorough appreciation
of an amusing situation are so perlectly tempered by a certain
