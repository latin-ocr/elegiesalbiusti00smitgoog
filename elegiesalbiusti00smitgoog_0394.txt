old·said sooth. Better tears, or even tage, than indifference. As Charles

63. quator ille boatus: the traditions and flavour of this phrase suggest
the epic in an exalted mood; cp. Odysr. 5, 326, τρὶς μάκαρες Δαναοὶ rat τετράκις,
212. ; Verg. A. 1, 94, ‘0 terque quaterque beati Ι quis ante ora patrum,' etc.;
Propert. 3, 7, 6, ‘obruis insano terque quaterque mari’; Ovid, Ars Amat. 2,
447, quoted above, etc. In the midst of a comparatively trivial subiect this
sudden rise to the dignity and solemnity 21 epic is a sly touch showing that
. the poet is not as serious as he would have 112 believe.

64. quo irato: ablative absolute standing for a clause.

65. scutumque sudemque: this alliterative combination is doubtless pop·
ular. The remaining errx. quoted by Wblffiin are Juv. 6, 248, ‘quem cavat

adsiduis sudibus scutoque lacessit ’ς Livy, 22, 1, 8 (which is not a parallel).
The phrase is one 21 the few 111 Tibullus illustrating alliteration in the

sense demanded by Wblfflin’s investigation (Simungsberichtc der Bayerisclre
Akademie zu Manchen, 1881, p. 1 1.), zie. as applying to the combination
or parallelism of similar parts of speech, of members syntactically coordi-

nated. 'We generally have nouns as here, so ‘caput collum,’ 1, 7, 52 (cp.
Seneca, Dial. 1, 6, 83 Gellius, 10, 12, 3), ‘caedes cruor,' 2, 3, 38 (cp. Ovid,
Τ rr'st. 1,11, 32; Fasti, 6, 5993 Seneca, Agam. 47), ‘ferro flamma,’ 1, 9, 21

(frequentin prose and poetry), ‘vincla verbera,' 2, 3, 80 (see n.); cp. ‘cho-
rus et cantus,' 1, 7,.44,21111’2111121222111111111111211112,1 2, 5, 2; then adjectives,
22, ⁴ ferus ferreus,’ 1, 10, 2; occasionally adverbs (as ‘satis superque ’) ; rarely
verbs (⁴ vivo valeo,’ ‘sentire sapere,’ 212). Such combinatione are usually in
pairs; three of a kind (ag. ‘veni‚ vidi, vici,’ ‘quod felix faustum fortunatum
sit ’) is naturally rare, and four or more, extremely so. The words may be
synonyms3 they may be different but belonging together and together extend-
ing and emphasizing a single concept, or lastly, they may form two links in a
chain 21 ideas or represent the beginning and end 212 series and thus include
all between. The Tibullian exx. all appear to belong to the second class.

As in many other languages this type 21 alliteration is frequent in popular
speech, 111 proverbe and proverbial phrases, even in proper names (‘ Titus
Tatius,⁹ ‘Iuno Iuga,' ‘John Jordan Jenkins,’ etc), but above all in Latin it
is characteristic 21 the old formal speech of law and religion and here it is
always 2212112112(ἰ.ι.112111211112112,’212.). The use of connectives is due to
the influence of later literary art. -que ·que as here, and ·que et are especially
