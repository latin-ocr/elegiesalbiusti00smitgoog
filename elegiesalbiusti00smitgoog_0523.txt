of this piece as demonstrated by the tcsts of Professor Postgate or of any one
else, is no criterion of authenticity. Are a poet's critical and creative facul·
ties always to remain stationary, shall he learn nothing with age and experi-
ence, shall he be unaffected by mood, by department, by theme, by a dozen
different things? ‘quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus,' the history of poets
and of poetry the world over is full of proofs to the contrary. It is interest- ⁵
ing to observe with Professor Postgate that this ol that phrase is ’1111011101-
table,’ or ‘infelicitous,' or a ‘weak variation' of something, we may observe
with him that coincidences with the aclrnowledged work of our author laclr
the Tibullian 'note of distinction‚’ we may admit for the sake of argument
the coincidences with Propertius and that the same is true also of them, we
may acknowledge that ‘Tibullus’ in 1, 3, 55, and 1, 9, 83 is more in lreeping
than ‘Tibullo’ in 4, 13, 13: but the sum total, even if we admit it, serves to
indicate why Tibullus neser published the piece rather than to prove that he
never wrote it at all. One may agree also with Professor Postgate that ’Τί-
bullo' in 13 is a presumption of genuineness rather than a proof. It isa
presumption, however, which is quite unaffected by any argument founded
upon inferiority as a criterion. The fact that the person to whom the piece
is addressed does not happen to be named has no bearing upon the question
either of its genuineness or of its date. The long line of commentators who
have tried to identify her with Delia or Nemesis or Glycera or some one else
have busied themselves with a taslr as fruitless as it is unnecessary. Any
poet at any time may and, to judge from the past, often does address verses
to a woman whom he does not name. She may be high o'r low, real or
imaginary; he may be old or young, married or single, in love with a dozen
women or in love with none. The assertion that this could not be an early
production of Tibullus is not supported by any of Professor Postgate’s argu-
ments. The piece is technically mature, but metrical technique, especially for
a poet witha lreen sense of form, is learned more easily and quickly than is
rhetorical technique. The absence of displaced que from this piece need not
detain us. Though eminently characteristic of Tibullus, it is nevertheless
absent from some of his published elegies (1, 2; 53 8 and 9). The same
may be said of the absence in this poem of the type of repetition to which
Professor Postgate calls attention in his ‘Poems of Tibullus and Others‚’
paraviti. ‘lt is remarkable,’ he says, ‘how often, if he uses a word more
than once, he will use it twice in the same poem and then maybe never agaim
and not merely the same word but exactly the same form of it.' This peculi·
arity, however, is not confined to Tibullus; it is more or less characteristic
of any one who writes. ‘Every writer knows,’ says Beeching (see Verity,
Shalrespeare, Coriolanus, 3), ‘the perverse facility with which a phrase once
