PREFACE

The criticism of Professor E. P30Morris, supervising e'ditor
of this series, has been at my service. Nor do I fail to
appreciate the generous cooperation of the publishers‚ and
especially of Mr. Everett E. Thompson. He has given
freely of his invaluable training and wide experience. My
old friend and colleague Professor Wilfred P. Mustard
has subjected the entire book to a rigid crossexamination,
and in its present form it owes much to¹ his relentless
accuracy‚ his candid criticism, and his refined taste.

My obligations to Professor Gildersleeve- his examina-
tion and criticism ol my Introduction is merely one of them
-cannot be estimated. By no means the least of these oh
ligations was incurred when 1 determined at the beginning
ol my long task that, so far as lay within my power, this
book should deserve the honour of dedication to the friend
whose living presence has enriched and inspired all my

academie life.
