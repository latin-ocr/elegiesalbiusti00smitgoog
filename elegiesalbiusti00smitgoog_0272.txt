spirited horse (first hexam), the second, as he breasts the mirrored waters
(first pentam.): theone, because he is bold aud daring (second hexam),
the other, because he is shamefaced and retiring (second pentum). Thus
within each distich hexameter is contrasted with pentameter: the first distich
contrasts two occupatione, the second, two temperaments: the occupatione
of the first distich anticipate and reflect the temperamenta of the second dis-
tich in the same order, ae. one is like three and two like four. In short, 1 4- 2
parallels3÷4,1:2::3:4‚1:3::224. Thisisan excellent example of that
strict observance of artistic symmetry and balance which characterizes the
entire elegy asa department and enters into the ‘unaflected simplicity' of
Tibullus quite as much as into the passionate luxuriance of Propertius or the
point and sparlrle of Ovid.

11-12. Two types of manly sport familiar to the literary tradition of both
Greece and Rome, Anth. Pal. 12, ¹9²3 Lulrian, Amor. 453 Achill. Tat. 2,
35-38; Philost. Epist. 27; Veget. 1, 105 Stat. Silv. 5, 2, ιι 3; Catull. 63, 643
Hor. Od. 4,1, 383 r, 8, 53 3, 7, 253 3, 12, 7. In Rome, it will be observed,
this ancient motive of erotic poetryis naturally associated with the Campus
Martius and the Tiber, cp. Cicero, Pro Caelio, 36 (speaking to the notorious
Clodia), ‘habes hortos ad Tiberim ac diligenter eo loco parasti quo omnis
iuventus natandi causa venit!

11. The boy's courage and dexterity are suggested by angwtis and com·
percit, which iudicate a spirited horse under perfect control, cp. 4,1, 91 ff.
-angustim ‘constraining,' ae. ‘tight,’ ‘close' In this active (= angustans)
and metaphorical use, only bere and occasionally in late prose, cp. however
Ovid, Met. 5, 410, ‘angustis inclusum cornibus aequor! The corresponding
passive use (= angustans), also rare, occurs first in Varius, ap. Macrob. 6, 2,
19, ‘angusto prius ore coercens {insultare docet campis fingitque morando,’
cp, too, Ovid, Ars Amat. 3, 274; Stat Theb. 2, 594, etc.

12. The beautiful picture suggested by placidam and niveo indicates not
so much courage and dexterityasgrace and beauty. Lygdamus'scomparatively
colourless imitation (3, 5, 30) brings the exquisite art of Tib. himself into
holder tebet—placidam: the Tiber is meant, cp. Ovid, Ars Amat. 3, 386,
‘nec Tuscus placida devebit amnis aqua'

13. quia: the only case of quia in Tibullus, cp. 1, 6, 21 n.

14. The innocence and shyness of a well-trained boy appealed with special
force to the ancients, cp. 4, 5, 173 Diog. Laert. ό, 2, 53 Seneca, Epist. 11,
13 Juv. ιο, 3003 ιι, ι54; esp. Plato, Charm.158; Anah. Pal. 12, 96.-
s‘tat ante: the phrase is unique in this connection and the figure intended is
not altogether certain. Such an ex. as Sueten, Nero, 48, ‘ante faciem ob·
tento sudario,’ suggests that stat ante here might = ‘ mantles’ the conventional
