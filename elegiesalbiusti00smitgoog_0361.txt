‘cuncta madent lacrimis et ab omni plangitur arce’3 Tasso, 19, 30, ‘ogni

. cosa di strage era gia piena! So also in Greek, cp. Ante. Pal. 5, 275, 8, Ἡ δ’

ὑποπιμπλαμένη δάκρυσιν εἶπε τάδε· Achill. Tat. 5, 15, δακρύων ἐμπεπλησμένος,

55-66. Having first attempted to work upon her desire (27-38) by paint·
ing the attractione of a young lover (ie. Marathus) and warning her that
her time for securing sneh a lover will soon be over, the poet again
(49-50) returns to the injunction of 27-28, and now attempts to work upon
her sympathies by quoting the boy’s own story. This is especially artistic

also reveals the boy himself, tbe spoilt minion who considers himself a finished
man of the world, but whose vanity is such that he is left utterly bewildered

-poterat2 the indicative here is idiomatic. ‘The Latin language expresses
possibility and power, obligation and necessity, and abstract relations gener·
ally, as facts: whereas our translation often implies the failure to realize.
Such expressions are debeo—apartet- necesse est- passum,’ etc. ‘The Im·
perfect, as the tense of disappointment, is sometimes used in these verbs to
denote opposition to a present state of things: debebam, 1 ought (but do
not) ; pateras, you could (but do not). These may be considered as con·
ditiouals in disguise.' Gildersleeve·Lodge, 254, Rern. 1. So 1, 9, 46; Pro·

Met. r, 4875 3, 3383 12, 558; 7, 692; Teisa 1,1,34; 2, 518, etc. The

57-58. An eminently natural touch, though 1 have not found it elsewhere
ln elegy and epigram. For the situation, Anile. Pal. 5, 127 ; 294.

57. Venus furtiva: Ovid, Ars Amat. r, 275; Tib. 1, 2, 343 4, 5, 7 and
