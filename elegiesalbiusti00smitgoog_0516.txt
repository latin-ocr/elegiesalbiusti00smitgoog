A note to Cerinthus telling him that the outing mentioned in the preceding
letter has been given up and that the birthday, she hopes (agatur), will be
celebrated at home.

1. ‘Do you know that that drearyjourney has been taken off your girl’s
heart,' cp. our colloquial ‘off one’s mind ’ -as of a burden removed-and
eg. Hor. Epist. 1, 5, 18 (of wine), ‘sollicitis animis onus eximit) For this
use of tollere with ex, cp. Propert. 1, 11, 8, ‘an te nescio quis simulatis ignibus
hostis Ι sustulit e nostris, Cynthia, carminibusi' Cicero, Amicii. 473 Seneca,
Agant. 620, etc. For this meaning of tollere, ep. Ovid, Ars Amat. 1, 718, and
often—puellae: dative, cp. 4, 4, 1 n.; Propert. 3, 11, 36, 'tollet nulla dies
banc tibi, Roma, notam ’; Ovid, Pont. 3, 5, 583 etc. For puellae: miti cp.
4, 11, 1 and 4, 12, 1. This lovers’ usage is a variety of the figure discussed in
482n

a. Romae: cp. domi, 2, 6, 48 n.

3. omnibus nobis agatur: aie. Cerinthus will now be present, cp. 4, 8, 2
above. Τ111 use of the dative of the agent with the tenses of continuance, as
here and in Lygd. 3, 5, 29, is poetical or admits ofa different explanation,
(Gildersleeve-Lodge, 354 n. 1). More common in Propertius (1, 7, 1 and 93
1, 8, 11 and 31; 2,1,1; 2, 23, 15 ; 2, 34, 583 3, 15, 41) and very frequent
in Ovid (more than 100 examples).-agatu1: optative.

4. ‘Which now, perhaps, comes to you as a surprise! qui refers grammat·
ically to dies, but of course Sulpicia's birthday, at least atthis stage of their ·
love affair, is the last thing to be 'a surprise’ to Cerinthus. The surprise can
only be the ‘fact that her birthday is to be celebrated at home after all, and
that she hoped to see him then, a pleasure which since the receipt of her last
letter (4, 8) he would naturally have given up. ’ ln other words, qui = quod,
attracted to the gender of dies but referring to the statement of 3 as a whole.
It is observed that the line suggests 1, 9, 43.-nec opinanti: the sphere
of this word in poetryis the comedy and Lucretius, never in the Augustan
poets except bere, nor in Catullus, nor, except Phaedrus, 5, 7, 8, in the poets
of the first century. In prose it is never used by Caesar and by Cicero only
in Fam. 15, 4, 6. On the other hand inopinans, always used by Caesar, is
never found in Cicero. The favourite form with the Augustan poets and their
successors is inopinus.

This most difficult and characteristically feminine of Sulpicia's letters was
written and sent to Cerinthus immediately after she had been told that bis
