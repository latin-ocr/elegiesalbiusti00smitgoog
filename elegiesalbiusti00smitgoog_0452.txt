24; Ovid, Fost. 2, 1073 Gellius, 16, 19) and very expensive, cp. eg. erel. ad
Herm. 4, 60, ‘uti citharoedus curn prodierit optime vestitus, palla inaurata in·
dutus, cum chlamyde purpurea, coloribus variis intexta,' etc. Hence regularly
worn-as in the statue of Skopas—by Apollo Kitharoidos, cp. Hom. Hymn.
3 (lo Apollo), 184 and 203; Kallimachos, Hymn. 2 (to Apollo), 32; Propert.
2, 31, 16; Ovid, Met. 3, 5563 '11, 166: and esp. Amor. 1, 8, 59, where the lena
instructing her pupil that gifts must always be demanded, says ‘ecce, quid iste
tuus praeter nova carmina vates Ι donat? amatoris milia multa leges. Ι ipse

' deus vatum palla spectabilis aurea Ι tractat inauratae consona fila lyrae!

8. sepositam: ‘laid aside’ (le. for special occasions). For this nalve,
touch, reflected, eg, in the universal habit of dressing up the images of the
'gods on feast days, cp. Hor. 0ιί. 3, 28, 2; Epocl9,1; Sat. 2, 6, 84; Tac.
Germ. 29; etc. So as here the gods are expected to dress themselves for such
occasions, cp.4, 6, 13; Stat. Silv. 2, 7, 53 Claud. Epithol. Pollod. 1003 etc.
9-10. No reference to this detail of the well-known story is now found in

Greek literature. Perhaps the authority of Skopas (note on 5 above) was ,

some tragedy now lost, cp. Seneca, Agom. 338 (to Apollo), ‘licet et chorda
graviore sones, Ι quale canebas Ι cum Titanas fulmine victos Ι videre dei,’ etc.
No other references *in Latin are quoted. Ariosto, O. F. 3, 3, 3, seems to be
a blended reminiscence of both Seneca and Tibullus, cp. ⁶ quella cetra Ι Con
che tu, dopo i gigantei furori, Ι Rendesti grazia al regnator de l'etra' (‘ that

noble lyre Ι Which sounded at your touch the Thunderer's praise, Ι What
time the Giants sank in penal fire,’ as Rose translates it). '
The Romans had viewed with horror the imminent prospect of seeing

Cleopatra and her horde established in their city and the recent defeat at
Actium was in every one's mouth, cp. Hor. Oa'. 1, 37; Propert. 4, 63 Manilius,
1, 914 (a long passage suggested by the themes developed by Tibullus in this¹
elegy), ‘necdum finis erat: restabant Actia bella Ι dotali commissa acie, repeti:
taque rerum Ι alea et in ponto quaesitus rector Olympi3 Ι femineum sortita
iugum cum Roma pependit Ι atque ipsa Isiaco certarunt fulmina sistro! The
analogy with that Olympian prototype, the rout of the Titans, was already
familiar through the statue of Skopas himself and was very likely developed
in some one of the many lost poems of the time (ag. Varius, Pan. Augrlstil).
Note that in this period the'war with the Titans was a stock· theme for epic,
cp.Pr0pert.2,1, 193 3, 9, 47 ; Ovid‚ Amor. 2, 1, 11, implies that he himself
once began to write a poem on this subject.

ιο. concinuisse: i.e. cecinisse, cp. 1, 3, 44 n. For this use of concino for
cono, cp. eg. Hor. Od. 4, 2, 33; Auson. Mosell. 443, etc. Here, however, as
elsewhere, the compound may have been suggested hythe idea of accom-
paniment, cp. line 88 below. '
