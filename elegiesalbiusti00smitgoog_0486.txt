which is perhaps on echo of Tibullus’s lines. John Dickenson’s song, ‘ Cupid’a
. Journey to Hell’ (111 his Arisbas, Euphues amidsl his slumbers, 1594) was
evidently suggested (probably indirectly) by Ausonius, l.c. Another favourite
type is represented by Lyly's ‘ Arraignment of Cupid’ (in'his Galatica, 1592).

15. acet Amor: i.e. ⁸ herce,' so 4, 2, 6. The epithet as applied to Cupid
is not found elsewhere. The epithet, however, as well as the entire passage
is yet another illustration of the old commonplace that Cupid is himself
utterly cruel and heartless, cp. 1, 3, ⁶43 1, 6, 2; 1, 10, 58; 2, 4, 5-6 note.-

' On the arrangement of the line cp. Ovid, Met. 2, 616, ‘nec non arcumque

17. mihidira precari: 1, 3, 82 n. To appreciate the force 01 this expres·
sion we must remind ourselves that in antique folk belief a curse or any other
invocation of the gods has a tendency to perform its mission automatically.
Its efficiency is not affected by the character 01 desertos him who pronounced
the curse, nor by his point of view at the time, nor even by the fact that he
afterward changed his mind. The essential power of the curse lies in its
form. If the form is correct —for words (cp. nomen, 2, 5, 57 n.) have a real
entity, a real relation to the things they represent -the curse becomes a
charm and the power invoked is obliged to obey.
