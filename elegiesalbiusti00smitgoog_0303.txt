1, 5, 37] TIBVLLVS

using one predicate with a series ol subjecte stated without connectives as in
2, 3, 383 ι, 7, 43-48; 2, 1, 633 ι, 3, 47. So too we have the usual rule
os the singular when the verb precedes or follows the first subject, asin 2, 4,
29-30. The chief rule, however, with Tib. is the rule ol the nearest; the
verb is stated with one subject and to be supplied with the rest. This
is seen especially where plural and singular subjects are combined, as in
1,2,77;1,3,23;1,3,47;1,8‚1;1,1o,3and9;2,1,89-9o;2,3,12;
2, 4, ¹3 ; cp. also r, ιο, 3; 2, 5, 73 ; 2,4, 1; r,2, 3⁰3. The adjective with
two nouns is plural in 1, 4, 37, cp. 1, 3, 2and n. In 1, 1, 75 it agrees
with the nearest (see n.), in 2, 3, 22 with the strongest (really the nearest,
see n. ad loa).

37-40. Imitated by Bertin, Amours, 2, 11, ‘Les Voyages.’

37-38. ι, 2, 1-6 n.

37. curas: of lovers’ troubles, as often, ag. 2, 3, 13; 2, 6, ςι; 3, 2, 29;
Propert. 1, 10, ¹73 2, 18, 213 3, 17, 4; Ovid, Amor. 2, ιο, 12; 19, 43, Ars
Amat. 1, 238, etc.

38. Ihave found no parallels for this pretty conceit. The lovelorn swain
in Calpurn. 3, 51 says, ‘te sine, vae misero, mihi lilia nigra videntur Ι 1166
sapiunt tontes et acescunt vina bibenti,' and another one in Nemes. 2, 42,
‘omnes ecce cibos et nostri pocula Bacchi Ι horreo nec placido memini con·
cedere somno ’ (which is very much like Lord Chumley’s ‘Can’t eat, can’t sleep,

can’t smoke: must be in love ’). —ver‘tertttz the pluperiect indicates resulting ¹
' condition in the past. ‘The wine was tears whenlcame to drinlr it Sorrow

had turned it,’ eto-omne merum: i.e. in every case, cp. oannis amor in 60.

39-40. The motto and the suggestion os Goethe’s Τ agebuch. ‘Choquant
et de mauvais gollt . . . mais bien vrai,' is Martinon's comment on the lines.
Mario Equicola, Di Natura a'Amore, Venice, 1626, p. 257, refers also to these
lines in a review ol the principal motives in Tibullus’s poetry. On p. 301 he
observes dryly that ‘Ama Tibullo Delia, lascia la per Nemesi, da Nemesi
correaNeera, ed ὲ si ardito che scrisse come la mente delle donnee mutabile?

39. saepe aliamtentti: old established doctrine acc. to Cicero, T use. Disput.
4, 75, ‘ etiam novo quidam amore veterem amorem tamquam clavo clavum eici·
endum putant,' and highly recommended by Ovid, Rem. Amor. 441. Hence
the complete lailure ol it here indicates the more clearly the poet's hope·
less condition. None ol the approved remedies avails. For tenen in this
sense, 1, 6, 35; Ovid, Amor. 3, 7, 3; etc.

40. admonuit dominae: omission ol the object (here me) in this cons.
οἰ admoneo is very rare.

41. devotum: i.e. ‘under a spell' The condition was, and in many
parts of Europe still is, habitually ascribed to magic, cp. Ovid, Amor. 3,
