TIBVLLVS

11. LIFE OF TIBULLUS

Our materials for the life of Tibullus are insufficient for restoring
even a bare outline of his career and personatity.1 They consist
of a few slight'references in his own works, certain passages in
the poems of his younger contemporary Ovid, two pieces addressed
to him by his friend Horace, and an anonymous vita which has
come down to us in some mss. of the author.

This vita, which is followed by an epigram ascribed to Tibullus’s
contemporary Domitius Marsus, is brief, vague‚ and unsatisfactory.
It has some value however, for, although corrupted and abridged
to an indefinite extent, it probably goes back ultimately to a life
of Tibullus once found in the De Foetes, a section now lost of the
De Vt'n‘s Inlustribus of Suetonius.

The epigram of Domitius Marsus, the leading poet of his type
in the Augustan Age, was doubtless quoted by Suetonius himself
in the text of the lost ‘vita Tibulli) It was evidently occasioned by
the fact that the death of our poet was coincident with that of
Vergil. We know from trustworthy sources that the author of the
Aeneid died at Brindisi on the aad of September, 19 ae. We
must therefore suppose that the death of Tibullus occurred either
orr that very day, which in itself is not impossible, or at a very brief
interval. Otherwise the epigram has no point, and Suetonius would
never have quoted it iu this connection.

This is the nearest approach to a definite date in the life of our
poet. The date of his birth is unknown and can only be stated
approximately. The vita says that he died young (⁴ obiit adules-
cens'), but immediately adds, ‘ut indicat epigramma supra scrip-
tum! Perhaps these words are the addition of a later hand. If

the important literature up to date, see Schanz. Gescltichte der Rom, Litteratur,

account of Tibullus as a poet and man is given by Sellar, Horace and the Elegiae ,
