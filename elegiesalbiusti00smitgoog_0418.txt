NOTES [2, 2, 18

Livy, and henceforth remains a genuine aud valuable possession of the lan·

guage. Unless we include 1, 10, 46 (which seems to me not certain) this is
the only ex. in Tibullus.

8. atque . . . et: 1, ro, 2311.

9-10. The poet pretends to interpret the will of the Genius. Note the
conversational language and tone of 10, aud for similar dramatic touches cp.
r, 5, 753 1, 6, 3; 4, 4, 15³ Hor. Od. 1, 27, 103 etc.

11. amores: ep. 1, 2, 59. This idiomatis emotioual plural (cp. our word
‘feelings’) is found in prose as well as in poetry, cp. eg. Verg. Α. 4, 28,
‘ille meos primus qui me sibi iunxit amores Ι abstulit: and Thes. nv. Some·
times this plural is due to the idea of reciprocity as in 1, 3, 81, where see u.
Or, again, this plural involves a number of iucideuts, manifestations, etc, as

¹ eg. in Plaut. Merc. 2, ‘meos amores eloquar,' aie. ‘my love affair?

ra. ‘llrat is, the gods have already heard you make the prayer so often.—
edidiclsse: compounds of disco always retain the reduplication of the perfect.

13-16. For the conventioual division of wealth, 1, 1, 1=2 n.

13. tibi ε 1, 6, 63 n.-malueris: potential subjunctive, cp. 4, 11, 43 1, 6,
74 n. ‘The perf. subjunctive as a potential seems'to have been very rare in
early Latin. Cicero extended the usage slightly and employed more persons ;
thus, first person plural and second singular occur first iu Cicero. From
Cicero's time the usage spreads, perhaps under the influeuce of the Greek
aorist. It was always rare with deponeuts and passives.' Gildersleeve-Lodge,
257, 2, n. 1. Blase (p. 205) quotes no other ex. of the second pers. as bere,
from the elegy. In Ovid, Met. 10, 560, ‘forsitan audieris,’ the perfect has its
full force.

14. valido: a common epithet of the ox, but perhaps iu this passage
intended also to suggesta heavy aud uuusually fertile soil.

15-16. 1‚1,51u.

16. The Mare Rubrum, Ἐρυθρὴ Θάλαττα, of the elassical writers is not
the Red Sea of modern parlance, but the Persian Gulf, cp. Strabo, p. 1086-7
¹ Mein, ete. unda rubet shows that Tibullus accepted (at least for poetical
purposes-which indicates his good taste) the traditional explanation of the
name. He doubtless knew better, as did the more important authorities of
his time, cp. eg. Strabo, l.c.‚ etc. lt was commonly believed that in that part
of the world the beach was strewn with jewels and pearls cast up by the sea,
cp.2,4, 303 4, 2, 19-20; Propert. 4, 5, 21, ‘si te an Dorozantum iuvat
aurea ripa’; Curt. 8, 9, 19, ⁶ gemmas margaritasque mare litoribus iufundit‚'
etc.

17. vota cadunt: ie. rata sunt, cp. 1, 5, 57; 1, 6, 85 ; etc.

18. flava vincula: stava here is usually iuterpreted as = lutea, the colom
