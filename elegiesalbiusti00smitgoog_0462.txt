who guards their return home on that same occasion, Aescolanus, the god ’
of copper money, but Argentinus, the god of silver money, eto-caelo
miserit: the use of the dative to denote the place whither begins with
Accius and is occasional afterward, esp. in the Augustan poeta. As a poetical
construction it seems to have sprung from personification (Gild.·Lodge, 358).
In most cases as probably here (‘ sent to High Heaven ’) the personilication had
an actual historical basis in the popular point of view and was still felt. The
⁰ old popular form caelus (cp. Petron. 45, etc.) for caelum suggests a god as
well as a place; and the dative here as, eg, in Vergil's famous ‘it caelo
clamorque virum clangorque tubarum,' 11, 192, may be called a revival of the
idea if not an actual record of the fact that it still existed. Cp. also Hor.
od. 1, 2, 1, ‘iam satis terris nivis atque dirae Ι grandinis misit pater’3 esp. ¹
Verg. Α. 6, 126, ‘facilis descensus Averno,’ where the dative is due to the
fact that Avernus, like Mors, is really a synonym of Orcus, and Orcus, like

Hades in Greek, is always a person, not a place (note that in modern Italian ¹

fairy tales ‘Orco’ :the Devil). Brugmann calls all these examples locatives.

45-46. Victoria hovers above (‘super') the side she intends to favour. ·
While making up her mind she flics¹ between the two sides, cp. Ovid, Met.
8, 13, ‘iter utrumque volat dubiis Victoria pennis’ She usually has wings‚ as
here, cp, however, the famous Nike Apteros. As a Roman goddess she ap·
pears as early as 294 rac. (Livy, ro, 33, 9).

For 46 cp. Ovid, Met. 14, 572, ‘tandemque Venus victricia nati Ι arma
videt, Turnusque cadit’ ,

47-48. A burning of the camp of the Rutuli is not mentioued elsewhere.
This is certainly the natural interpretation, though the occasional use of
incendio :facea ‘torches’ (eg. Verg. A. 9, 71 ; Ovid, Met. 14, 539) lends
some support to the suggestion that the Sibyl is referring to the well-known
story of Turnus's attempt to fire the Trojan ships (Verg. Α. 9, 71 ; Ovid, Met.
14, 530), i.e. she sees the g'lare of the torches in the camp of the Rutuli as
they are preparing for the deed. Vergil says in the parallel passage (9, 71),
‘classem . . . invadit sociosque incendia poscit ovantes Ι atque manum pinu
flagranti fervidus implet! But Tibullus is rarely obscure so far as his lan·
guage is concemed, and with only his own line before us we should never put
such an interpretation upon it. It seems better, therefore, to adopt the solu-
tion of the difficulty just offered by Deutsch, ‘Notes on the Text of the Corpus
Tibullianum,’ Univ. os Calisornia Pub. in Closs. Phil. Vol: 2, Νο.9 (June,
1912), pp. ato-214. He calls attention to the fact that the reading of AV
-our best MS authority—is not Rutulis but rutilis (cp. also Achilles
Statius, Comm. in Tib. ad loc, and Carlo Pascal, Rivirta di Fi'lologia,17, ⁶
452). rutilus is frequently used asan epithet of fire, and the extension of it
