2, 5, 48] TIBVLLVS

' to objects merely reddened by fire seems fairly justified by such passages as
Hor. od. 1, 2, 2-4, and Verg. G. 3, 358-359, especially when accompanied,
as here, by lucent and incendia in the same line. In other words, castris is
the camp (and fleet) of Aeneas, and what the Sibyl sees is the very event to
which Vergil refers.

48. barbare: i.e. ‘cruel, savage,' cp. Propert. 3, 16, 14, ovid, Amor. 1,
7, 19, etc, not the Greek use, though ultimately derived from the same point

ofvicw. The suggestion that the Sibyl is speaking here as a Greek is too ⁸
learned and exotio, not to s'ay in too bad taste for Tibullus—necem: the '
death of Turnus is the closing scene of the Aeneid.

49. Laurens cestrum: see 41 n.-Laviui: Lavinium was the second

town founded by Aeneas aster his treaty with Latinus and marriage l

with Lavinia (Livy, 1, 1, 113 Verg. A. 1, 258 ; Dionys. Hal. ι, 59 f.).
Like Alba longa it was closely associated with the religione life of the
Roman state, esp. with the worship of Vesta and the Penates (43-44 n.).
After the destruction of Alba Longa and the dissolution of the old
· Latin League, and esp. after the intrusion of the Aeneas legend, Lavinium
was considered the mother city of Rome. The Penates of both were there·
fore the Penates which Aeneas brought from Troy and they were worshipped
at regular intervals by official representatives of the Roman state. Even the
fite ou the altar of Vesta at Lavinium and therefore at Rome was supposed
to go back to the fire of the Trojan Vesta, cp. Dionys. Hal. 2, 65 ; Propert.
4, 4, 693 Ovid, Met. 15, 7303 Fasti, 1, 528, etc. -estr on the singular verb
with three subjecta see 1, 5, 36 n.

50. Alba Longa: 30 years after the death of Aeneas founded by Ascanius,
cp. esp. Verg. A. 1, 267, etc. For the prodigy of the sow and thirty pigs
connected with it cp. Verg. A. 8, 43 ς Varro, De Re Rust. 2, 4, 18, etc. For
further particulars see Livy, 1, 33 Dionys. Hal. 1, 66; etc. One ancient er·
planatiou of the name is given by Livy, l.c., ‘ab situ porrectae in dorso urbis
Alba Longa appellata’; another by Varro, L. L. 5, 144, ‘ab sue alba nomi·
natum’ (then relating the prodigy of the sow). The name, however, is cer·
tainly not Latin, possibly Ligurian and :the ‘mountain town’ (Helbig).

Praetically every available situation on the Lago di Albano has been selected i

by some modernscholar for its site. The latest, Ι believe, is Castel'Gandolfo
(Ashby) and on the whole this seems the best.

Doubtless Tibullus follows Vergil in identifying Ascanius with the son of
Aeneas’s Trojan wife. This was the usual version. Livy, however, l.c., refers
to an account which made him the son of Aeneas and Lavinia.

51-54. The story of Ilia, the Vestal who was the mother by Mars of
Romulus and Remus, was told by Naevius in his epic and doubtless too in

458
