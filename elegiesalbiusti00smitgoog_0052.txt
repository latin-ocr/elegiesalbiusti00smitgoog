INTRODUCFION

unannounced, and his Delia, just as she is, with her hair down and
in her bare feet, flies to meet him. A passage none the less
beautiful because it reminds one of Lucretia and Collatinus rather
than of poor Delia and her present coniunx, the poet.

So far the happiness of the lovers has been undisturbed by any
fault of their own. The insertion of the intercalary fourth at this
place, like the favourite points suspensrfs in a F rench novel, might be
taken to imply that time has elapsed and that things have hap·
pened. At any rate the fifth elegy indicates that such is the
case.

In consequence of the tempting offers ofa dives amator aided

and abetted by his agent, the lena, the lovers had a violent quarrel
and parted. Delia took up with her dives amator, and when at
the opening of this elegy the poet desires to return to her, he
finds himself a mere outsider. Moreover Delia herself—untrue
to one, untrue to all-has already begun an intrigue with still an-
other lover. A pitiful situation, and by no means improved in the

sixth and last poem of the series
Here Delia has a coniunx, and is intriguing with a lover—ap· ’

cannot trust her word. He himself taught her to deceive, and now
his own instructions return to plague him. Then he tums to the
coniunx for help. ‘Cherish me‚' he says, ‘if you wish to keep the
girl in order. 1 know her tricks, and Ι know every trick of a lover.
Have I not practised them all on you in my time P What business
have you with an attractive wife, if you cannot watch her? Leave
her to me. Ι will see to it that she is guarded from the rest of the
world,' etc. A situation worthy of Swift or of de Maupassant!
Finally, turning to Delia, the poet warns her that Bellona
threatens to punish her for her infidelity (to him l). He hopes
that the punishment will be light. ‘Not however on your account,'
he adds, ‘but for your good old mother. May you live long, dear
