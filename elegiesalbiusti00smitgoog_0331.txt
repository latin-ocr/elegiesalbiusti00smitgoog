The Arar —no schoolboy ever forgets Caesar’s description oi it—joins the
Rhone at Lyons, ‘qua Rhodanus raptum velocibus undis Ι in mare sert Ararim’
(Lucan, 1, 433) and the two streams are the most notable feature of the city.
It is now called the Sadne.

say as misleacliug, a description oi its actual colour as it is to speak of the
‘beautiful blue Danube,' although we might appeal to the authority oi Tibullus
ior the one, to the authority oi Ovid (Pont. 3, 5, 2, ‘hinc ubi caeruleis iungitur

colour of the skies. The sky is generically blue or grey, but no one colour
