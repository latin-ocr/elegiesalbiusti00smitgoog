NOTES [2, ι, 87

Cupido pulcher est: Ι totus estin armis idem, quando nudus est Arnor'; cp.
2, 5,105-6; Spenser, The Faqrie Queene, 1, Prot. 3-

And thou, most dreaded impe oi highest Jove,

Faire Venus sonne, that with thy cruell dart

At that good Knight so cunningly didst reve,

'that glorious fire it kindled in his hart;

Lay now thy deadly beben bowe apart,

And, with thy mother mylde, come to mine ayde, etc.

The toreh, bow, and quiver are standing attributes oi Cupid throughout
Hellenistic and Roman poetry. They appeared in art somewbat earlier than
¹ the fourth century B. e.

81. dapibus: not a mere substitute lor ad with the accus. The soree os the
dative here as osten is better rendered by ‘for' than ‘to,' cp. pecori below.
Iu other words, ‘veni dapibus sestis' is not only an invitation to come but,
also to take part. Or again, as eg. in Propert. 1, 15, 8, ‘ut formosa novo quae
parat ire viro,’ i.e. go to, and become his, cp. 2, 5, 44n.; 1, ς, 27 n. dapibus
here is probably a dativus conimodi rather thane dative of the object sor
which-pone: tor depone, cp. 1, 3, 44 n.

83-84. The invitation to Cupid (81-82) naturally brings the poet back
from his long digression to the festal scene before him.

83. vos: 1,1, 33 n.—celehrem: ie. ‘to whom many resort,’ cp. 1, 3, 33 ;
1, 6, 173 2, t, 33 and notes. -vocate voce, i.e. ‘call aloud upon,’ old-sasb-
ioned and formal, cp. n. on edidit ore, t, 4, 73.

84. clam, ete: according to antique beliesa prayer (like a charnu, which
isreally the same thing) must actually be uttered (or written) in order to
reach the ears oi the gods. Hence, 1, 2, 45, where see n, and the nalve
practice to which the poet here alludes os nialring one’s ‘vota parum honesta’
,in a whisper so that one’s fellow worshippers may be none the wiser, cp. Hor.
Epist. 1, 16, 60, ‘labra movet metuens audiri: “pulchra Laverna, Ι da mihi
fallere, da iusto sanctoque videri, Ι noctem peccatis et fraudibus obice nu·
bem l ”³ Persius, 2, 6; Seneca, Epist. 10, 5, ‘quanta dementia est hominum!
turpissima vota dis insusurrant: si quis admoverit aurem, conticescent et, quod
scire hominem nolunt, deo narrant,’ etc.

8⁶. tibia: the Phrygian tibia wasastraight tube ol wood withacurved piece
os horu or metal (κώδων) at the end. Hence, the epithet curva here. It was
much used in the orgiastic worship ol Kybele (ι, 4, 68 n.) and hence would
be au able second to the noisy merrirnent oi the crowd in drowning the sound
(obstrepit) os prayers to the gods.

87-90. Tibullus shows at his best in these exquisite lines which remind one
