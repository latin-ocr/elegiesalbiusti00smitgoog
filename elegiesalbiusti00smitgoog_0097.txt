TIBVLLVS

blessed in Elysium and the turtures of the damned in Tartarus;
among them he mentions last the punishment oi the daughters of
Danaos, “ Danai proles Veneris quod numina laesit.” This thought
<carrying with it the characteristic parable os warning to Delia)

. leads him baclr by the force oi contrast to the brightest picture

which his imagination can paint in the world os the living, that of
Delia spinning among her haudmaids, and of his own unexpected
return. There is no mechanical arrangement, but rather a har-
monious combination oi his materials, their successiou being regu-
lated sometimes by the suggestions of similarity, sometimes oi
contrast. The peaceful joys oi the country are in many oi the
elegies set over against the dangers and the rough life of the
soldier, and the joy oi youth and love is made more intense by
the thought ol death. There is nothing forced or strained in his
manner of treatment: no undue emphasis or exaggeration os
colouring. He is impressive by the truth and simplicity os his

separate pictures, and their harmony with the moods to which he , l

wishes to give expression!

Osten, as in 1, 3, he prefers to begin with the contrast, the
negative oi his underlying theme, and' to eud with the positive
statement, having passed from the one to the other bya series
os conflicting views —a sort os echo of the ἀγών, as Crusius ob-
serves, except that the opposing sentiments are in the speaker’s
own breast. ’

In short the· most characteristic feature of our poet’s rhetorical
exposition is that it proceeds by parallelism, comparison, contrast,
by statement and counterstatement, desirable and undesirable,
negative and positive, running off from time to time into variations
which seem to halt lilre eddies in a flowing stream, albeit the
stream continues to ilow steadily onward until it reaches the end.
To paraphrase the words os Vahlen, ‘the poetry oi Tibullus moves
like the waves oi a summer sea. We sway in rhythmic cadence,
now iorward, now backward, yet from time to time the erest of
some succeeding billow carries us insensibly a little farther on!
