about from town to town (69) with a ‘float' representing a small temple con·
taining a figure of the goddess. They also sang hymns (Galliambic) to the
wild Phrygias strains in honour of the Magna Mater, solicited contributions,
prophesied, sold charms, cure-alls, etc. (Dionys. Hal. Antiq. Rom. 2, 19,
Babrios, 141 Crus.; Anth. Pal. 6, 217, Lukian, Asin. 35, Apul. Met. 8,
24, eto).

The special festival referred to in line 70 commemorated the death and .
resurrection of her beloved Attis (in. of Spring). The effort of the Galli ou
that occasion was to ‘get the spirit' (ἐνθυαιασμός, ἔκστασις), hence their
fauatic dancing, their wild screeching and singing, amid the continual diu of
certain instruments ofa specifically Phrygian type (2, 1, 8611), showing
their sympathy with her joy by extravagant demonstrations and with her sor·
row by slashiug themselves with knives and even by castrating themselves iu
imitation of Attis himself, cp. Ante. Pal. 6, 234, Ovid, Fasti, 4, 221, Pro·
pert. 2, 22, 16; Mart. 11, 84, 3, Juv.2, 115, Servius on Verg.A. 9, 115, etc.
Hence they wore women's clothes and their hair which they kept long was
perfumed and done up in feminine fashiou (Anth. Pal. 6, 219, 234, 237,
Augustin. at). 7, 26, eto). The general opinion, on the whole well·
founded, was that at the best they were a beggarly lot of effeminati, at the
worst, the lowest of the low. In short, they are a curiously complete prototype
of the begging friars of the Middle Ages-currus: the plural is generic or
better still perhaps, distributive, ie. now oue, now another. The boy's curse
is aggravated by the suggestion that he is not evento remain with one gang
of priests but is so low even in such a class that he wanders from one to
another. '

(cp. mille and sescenti, 1, 3, 50 n.) is not uncommou, Catull. 9, 2, 12, ιο,
48, 3, Hor. Sat. 1, 5, 12, 2,3,116; Mart. 2, 13 12, 70, 7, etc. tercenteni

(cp. too 1, 5, 55) suggests the arch wanderer who πολλῶν 1‘ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν
