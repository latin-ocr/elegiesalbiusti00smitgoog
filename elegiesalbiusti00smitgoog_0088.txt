taste it is the model of its kind, and the poet of 4, 4 was particu-
larly successful in his interpretation of it.

In 4, 12 Sulpicia apologizes to Cerinthus for having left him
so abruptly the previous evening. ‘She bitterly regrets now
that she was so young and foolish as to run away—and only

because she was afraid to show how much she loved him.’ The
words suggest an advanced stage in the courtship of these two
young things. Indeed the characteristically feminine mixture
of motives responsible for the last two lines would occupy at
least a chapter in a modern psychologieal novel. As it stands
it is arevelation‚ the more eloquent because wholly unconscious‚
of the girl’s gentle nurture and essential innocence. She shrank
back instinctively from the prospect of complete surrender, for
of course this was the real motive‚ or rather the principal motive‚
of her llight. The motive itself, and the fact that she does not
betray it except by inference, are both ao feminine and so true
to nature, yet at the same time so rare in conventional literary
art, that we must believe these letters to be the astonishingly
faithful record of a genuine love affair.

4,.10, the most difficolt, and perhaps the most thoroughly
characteristic of Sulpicia’s letters, was evidently written and sent
to Cerinthus immediately after she had been told that his atten-
tions were being bestowed elsewhere. Every line palpitates with
the suppressed fury of a passionate, high-spirited Roman girl who
has been cut to the quick‚ not only in her love, but in her pride.
She is in no mood for euphemisms. Indeed th'e tone of the en·
tire communication, especially the biting irony of the clause of
‘perverse purpose,’ ‘ne male inepta cadam’ (see l. 2 and note),
may well bave been associated with an only too vivid memory of
the scene of 4, 12 and a realization of the narrowness of her
escape.

The rising tide of wrath and scorn is marked by the sudden
shift from bitter irony in r-2 to the passionate assertion of utter
indifference in 3-4‚ as expressed in the characteristic demand of
