NOTES [1, 7, 34

Hades, the ghosts of all the friends whom he had murdered ‘cum plausu
procedunt cantantes: εὑρήκαμεν, συγχαίρομεν.’ See also r, 3, 23-24 11.

29-48. The dawn of civilization aud the development of the arts is a
ravourire digression with the Roman poets. Tib., as usual, repeats himself else·
where, cp. 2, 1, 37 ff. 'lhis account of Osiris, given by Tib., shows a certain
kimhip with Diod. 1, 14 1.

29-30. In pure Greek tradition the invention of the plough was ascribed
to Demeter or Triptolemos. For Osiris as here, cp. Diod. r, 293 Servius on
Verg. G. 1, 147; etc.

²9· araim the plural is genuine-manu sollerti: 1, 1, 8 n.

30. teneram humum: a good description oi the fresh alluvial soil oi
Egypt. See Cicero, MD. 2, 130, ‘Aegyptum Nilus inrigat et cum tota
aestate obrutam oppletamque tenuit, tum recedit mollitosque et oblimatos ⁴
agros ad serendum relinquit’; Verg. G. 2, 292, Ovid‚ Fast. 3, 357, etc.—
eollicitavit: ele. ‘stirred’ The old-fashioned, literal use of poetry and
post-Augustan prose. For its use in this connection, Verg. G. 2, 418, ‘sollici-
tanda tamen tellus pulvisque movendus ’3 Ovid‚ Fert. 4, 396, ⁶ quas tellus nullo
sollicitante dabat,’ etc. .

31. inexpertae: passive, cp. Ovid‚ Trist. 3, 8, 2, ‘nunc ego Triptolemi
cuperem consistere curru, Ι misit in ignotam qui rude semen humum’; Val.
llaec. 1, 69, ‘ignaras Cereris qui vomere terras Ι imbuit et flava quercum
damnavit arista? -commisitr rie. the seed is a depositum for which the soil
is now responsible. 'lhis idea of the relation between the farmer and his
land is widespread in Latin, and is expressed 111 many different ways; cp. 2,
3, 62; Verg. G. 1, 223; 2, 460; Cic. Sen. 5¹³ etc.

32. 11011 notis: ie. hitherto not known.

33-34. Vine culture is described by two of its most important details,
adligatio and ampusatio, training and pruning. The training of vines on
stakes or props was the ancient practice in Lower Italy (cp. Οἰνωτρία, the
ancient name sor that country) and is now the rule cg. in southern France
and elsewhere. More common among the Romans, aud this may still be
observed eg. in Umbria, was the use of elms or poplars for this purpose.
References literal and metaphorica] to this method are constantly recurring,

Catull. 62,49; Verg. G. 1, 2; etc. On pruning the vine see e-g. Verg. G. .

2, 362, and on pruning in general as marking a stage (ae. the cultivation of
fruits, etc.) in the development of civilization‚ cp. Lucretius, 5, 935. For
Osiris as discoverer of the vine see Diod. 1, 15, 8.

34. viridem: the juxtaposition with dura here suggests that the adjective
carries with it the idea of tender as well as green, cp. ennam ferro, l. 30 and
1, 8, 3ο n.-comem: a familiar figure in Latin but not tolerable in English.
