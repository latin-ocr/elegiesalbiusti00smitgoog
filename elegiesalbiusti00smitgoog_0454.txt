Α tion of shrines at which the presence of a Sibyl is expected. Strictly speak-
ing, therefore, Sibyl was not a common noun used to designate one os a type,
but a proper noun, the original Sibylla, used to designate her representative

elsewhere. Indeed, one of the favourite methods of explaining the multiplic- .

ity of Sibyls was to assume that they were ¹in reality one and the same, i.e.
that the original Sibyl had made her appearance in the given place and had
remained there sor a time. The tradition, sor example, that the Cumaean
Sibyl was the Erythraean Sibyl, ie. that she came to Cumae 1'10111 Erythrae,
is as old as Aristotle, Mirabilia, 95. It was accepted by Varro, and Livy, 1,
7, 8, shows that it must have been current in Tibullus's time. Varro also
repeats the opinion that it was the Cumaean Sibyl who sold the books to ’
Tarquin, ie. the Sibyl to whom Tibullus is here referring. After discussing
the various Sibyls, Varro says, ‘harum omniurn Sibyllarum carmina et feruntur
et habenturpraeterquam Cumaeae cuius'libri a Romanis occultantur nec eos
ab ullo nisi a XVviris inspici sas est’ (cp. Tib. 17-18). That it was also the
Cumaean Sibyl who prophesied to¹ Aeneas would naturally be stated by
Tibullus (19 and n.); this had already been adopted by Vergil for his great
national epic, the sixth book of which was undoubtedly familiar to our poet.

16. senis pedibus: the oracles oi the Sibyl were all in Greek hexame-
ters. For this paraphrase of hexametris cp. Hor. Sat. 1, 10, 59, ‘mollius ac
siquis pedibus quid claudere senis! -canitr ie. they still exist and are con-
sulted, cp. note on babet, 2, 4, 55.

17-18. Α passage in Vopiscus, Aurei. vit. 19, says that the X Vviri
handled the Libri Sibyllini ‘velatis manibus,' but the method of selection is

naturally not known. Niebuhr's theory that verses were selected at randum ,

per sortes receives some apparent support from line 69 and from Lactant. 1,

6, 12, in which the eracles of the Sibyl are called sortes (but see n. on 69-7 ). .

Cicero, Div. 2, 111, and Varro (in Dionys. Hal. 4, 62) tell us that all genuine
eracles of the Sibyl were acrostic (cp. an ex. in the Oracula Sibyllina, 8, 217-
250 Rzach). But that the acceptedly genuine eracles of the Sibyl were
marked by this comparatively recent invention in the art of versification is
unlikely in itseli and would certainly be unknown to Cicero, Varro,.or any one
else except the X Vviri themselves.

17. sacrae chartas: ie. the libri Sibyllini now in the temple on the
Palatine.

18. Note that the two halves os the pentameter are alike, ie. the first hemi·
stich like the' second consists os two dactyls and ends in an iambic dissyllable.
This is rare in Tibullus, see Introd. p. 99.

19. haec dedit Aeneae sortes: ie. the Sibylla of line 15, where see note.
Vergil located the prophecy of the Cumaean Sibyl at Cumae and some
