INTRODUCTlON

not, the statement of the vita is valueless; for Marsus himself says
‘iuvenis' not ‘adulescens' and every one knows that ‘iuvenis’ is
as indefinite as ‘encore jeune' or the lady's ‘twenty-nine!

We may be sure however that Tibullus died before his time.
It is suggested by certain aspects of his second and last hook and
by the fact that Horace (born 65 uc.) speaks to him as to a
younger man. It is also implied by Ovid, Trr'st. 4, ro, 51 -

Vergilium vidi tantum nec amara Tibullo
tempusamicitiae fata dedere meae,

but more definitely by the verses immediately succeeding, in
which he names the four great elegiae poets of Rome ending with Ι
himself —

successor fuit hic tibi, Galle ; Propertius illi;
quartus ab his serie temporis ipse fui.

The order here, as Ovid expressly states, is chronological, and
hence we have Gallus (born in 69), Tibullus, Propertius Ovid
(born in 43). Itis usual therefore to place the birth of Tibullus
at not far from 54 s.c.¹ In that case he would be 35 at the
time of his death, quite old enough perhaps to find his age a
handicap to success in alove affair (Hor. Od. 1, 33, 3), but
whether still young enough to justify the definition of ‘ adulescens’
will depend to some extent upon the age of the definer.

The nomen gentile of Tibullus was Albius, and Horace, who fur·
nishes our only surviving examples of address to him in person
(Od. r, 33, 1 ; Epist. 1, 4, 1), always so designates him.² ‘Albius
Tibullus’ occurs only in the old commentators on Horace (Acro,
Od. 1, 33, 15 Epist. r, 4, r; Porph. Od. 1, 33, 1), in Diomedes

¹K. P. Harrington, Proceed. Am. Phil. Assoc. 33, pp. cxxxvii ff. For Canault's
discussion see his edition of Tibullus, p. 5.

²Baehrens, Tibulliscke Bldtter¹ Jena, 1876, p. 7 (followed, eg„ by Postgate,
Selectr'ons from Tib. and Others, 1903, p. 179), tried ro prove that our poet is not
the Albius of Horace. Ι1 is hardly worth while now to discuss and refute this
theory; see, however, eg„ Cartault, ‘Horace et Tibulle· Revue de Philol. 3ο,
aro-217: Ullmam A.J. P. 33, 149; Postgate, id. 377.
