43-44. Cp. Diodoros, 1, 18, ε1ναι γὰρ τὸνὊσιριν φιλογέλωτά τε sal χαί-
ροντο μουσικῇ καὶ χοροῖς. . . . οὐγὰρ πολεμικὸν eluar τὸν Ὀσιριν, οὐδὲ ταρα-

, 44-45. Anaphoraof sed is very uncommon (Vollmer, Stat. Sitv. 2, 6, 9 n.),

44. levis amor: 1, 1, 73 n; 2, 5, 96 n.; Ovid, Amor. 3, 1, 41 ; Propert.
2, 12, 4; cp. κοῦφοςἘρωτ, Anth. Pal. 9, 443 etc. — aptus is predicative.

45-48. The lines suggest the progresses ol Bacchos, the Dionysiae festival,
etc, so often mentioned in the poets, cp. Ovid, Met. 3, 5543 Hor. Od.2,19,
173 Eurip. Bacchai; Diodoros, 1,17,etc.

45. corymbis: the ivy was sacred to Bacchos. Hence his epithet oi
corymbiser iu Ovid, Fast. 1, 393, etc. Ovid, Fast. 3, 767 gives the reason.

46. lutea: yellow (luteus, croceus) is associated with Bacchus. It was the
colour worn by the temple giris; in fact in Greece, as in all the Orient, yellow is
worn hyali dedicated to the god ; so the Eunuchs of the Dea Syria (Apul.
Met. 8, 27, etc), and to this day the Buddhist monks. The wearing oi
yellow by the hetairai (eg. in the comedy) would seem to have been an
inheritance from the hierodulai, but the right of Attic women in general to
wear the colour was acquired at an early date. Hence yellow, in later times
at least, may be called the iestal colour, cp. Catull. 61, 103 68,134; Ovid,
Met. 10, 1; Seneca, Oed. 4213 Pliny, 21, 46, etc. The conventional signifi-
cance os colours forms a long and curious chapter in the history of human
thought. -pallar the palla (cp. 4, 2, 11 and n.), sometimes worn by Apollo
and Hermes (Ouid, Met. 3, 556, etc), was regularly worn by Bacchus,
Aristoph. Ran. 463 Propert. 3, 17, 323 Stat. Achill. r, 262; Seneca, Herc.
rur. 475; Oed. 421 ; etc.

47. Tyrias vestes are of course iestal, cp. 4, a, 11 and n.; Ouid, Met. 3,
556; etc-tibia: the tibia is regularly associated with Bacchos and festival
occasions, cp. Qvid, Met. 3, 533; 4, 3923 Verg. Α. 11, 737, Val. Flacc. 6,
1423 Hor. Od. 4, 15, 303 etc-cantu: for the ablat. with dulcis, cp. 54
