20. Larem the Penates are meant, but as these two classes of household
gods were worshipped side by side, the confusion is not infrequent, cp. Plaut.
Ruri. 1206; Cicero, Quinct. 853 etc.

ar. nec credebat cum respiceret: ‘as,' ia. ‘when(ever) he looked
back he could not believe: cp. 1, 5, 9 n.

22. ardentes: to be taken of course with both Ilion and deos, cp. 1, 1, 243
1, 5, 3611. For the displacement of que, see 1, 1, 40 n.-deos: ale. ‘templa

aperitur Apollo’3 3, 5523 4, 671; 2, 74²3 Ouid, Fast. 6, 437; etc. So

that according to common belief the gods actually did inhabit their statues.
Even the Fathers did not deny- it in many cases. They merely insisted that
the tenants were not gods, but demons. Doubtless many of the masterpieces
of antiquity were destroyed for this reason. The most famous case of the
survival of this belief is the mediaeval story of the ‘Ring of Venus’

23-38. It is already time for the Sibyl’s prophecy, but the poet's allusion to
the long sea voyage not only malres it clear that the prophecy did talre place
before Aeneas set out, but also leads us as it were unconsciously into a favourite
topic with the writers of his time. This is the contrast between old and new
Rome, cp. Verg. A. 8, 357; Propert. Δ, r ; esp. Ovid, Fasti, 1, 509 (which also
illustrates our poet’s device here of postponing the main issue in favour ofa
digression).

The device here has often been criticized. Asa matter of fact, however, ,

this is uot a digression except iu outward form. The poet's object is to con-
trast Rome the primitive hamlet with Rome the mistress of the world. The
digression, springing naturally from what precedes, furnishes the one, the Sibyl’s
prophecy pictures the other. Reversal would not only have destroyed the
natural rhetorical order of the two contrasted ,descriptions but also would
have interfered with an easy transition to the following topics.

23. aeternae urbis: the first occurrence of this famous title of Rome.
We find it a few years later in Ovid, Fasti, 3, 72 (also speaking of Romulus),
‘iam modo qua fucrant silvae pecorumque recessus, Ι urbs erat: aeternae cum
pater urbis ait,’ etc, and then long afterward in Ausonius, 22, 4, 1, ‘urbis ct
aeternae deductam rege Quirino Ι annorum seriem,' etc. The idea, however,
which is associated with that of Rome as mistress of the world (57-60 n.) and
appears as early as Cicero, Phil. 2, 51, first became prominent in the early years
of the imperial regime when these lines were written, and when Vergil
