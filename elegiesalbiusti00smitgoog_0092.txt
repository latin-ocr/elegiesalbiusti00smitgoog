INTRODUCTION

Cerinthus of 4, 4, 11422, and the shy and wordless, but sorely
smitten, Cornutus of 2, 2, 9-12. The question however is
incapable of a definite solution, and it is the part of wisdom to
leave it so.

Two pieces, 4, 13 and 4, 14, remain to be considered. The first,
which protests unalterable fidelity to some woman unknown, is
ostensibly signed by Tibullus himself (l. 13).¹ The second and
last poem, also presumably by Tibullus, is an epigram of four lines.
They apparently belong to an earlier manner, and had probably
been rejected by the poet himself. Perhaps they were found
among his papers after his death. At all events the character and
contents of books 3 and 4 as a whole indicate clearly that we have
before us a collection of poems all emanating from the circle of
Messalla during the timewhen Tibullus was a member of it. This
and the fact that a number of pieces were evidently not intended
for general circulation suggest that the editor actually had access
to the archives of Messalla’s household, and that he added all he
found there to the existing edition of Tibullus with the idea of
giving to the world the surviving record of whatever bore directly
or indirectly upon the poet's literary activity.

Such being the case it seems likely that except for three or four
slight lacunae dne to imperfect transmission the edition of Tibullus
now before us is not only complete, but contains some pieces which
he himself had not intended to publish.

VI. TEXTUAL TRADITION

It has already been observed that the tradition of Tibullus during
the Middle Ages is unusually slight. In fact it seems likely that
the preservation of our poet from the ninth to the thirteenth cen-
tury is dne to F rance, and that here we owe a special debt of gratitude
to the literary tastes and personal influence of the famous Latin poet

and teacher Hildebert (died 1134). That a few mss. of our author
