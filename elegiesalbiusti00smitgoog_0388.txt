NOTES [1, ro, 38

Hermesianax ap. Athen. 13, 597 B, 3; Seneca, Herc. Fur: 764, Juv. 3, 266,
etc.), frequently occurs in the epitaphs, is a striking figure in the remains oi ’
Etruscan art, and among the modern Greeks, by whom he is called Charos or
Charontas‚ he has usurped the place and functions of Hades himself. turpis
as an epithet oi him is found only here, but both literature and art unite in
attesting the fitness oi it. See, for example, Vergil, A. 6, 298 -

Portitor has horrendus aquas et flumina servat
terribili squalore Charon, cui plurima mento
canities inculta iacet, stant lumina flamma,
sordidus ex umeris nodo dependet amictus.
ipse ratem conto subigit velisque ministrat

et ferruginea subvectat corpora cumba,

iam senior; sed cruda deo viridisque senectus.

The inner man is mirrored in his outward semblance and hence turpis,
αἰσχρός, ‘foul' (in its old and new sense), may apply to personal appearance
as well as to personal character.

37-38. Thetis, theghosts bear upon them traces oi the iuneral fires by
which their mortal parts were destroyed. Sometimes the face is picturerl as
flattened or disfigured by the waters oi Lethe (ae. the features are blurred more
or less by decomposition). The two ideas together give a touch oi peculias

horror to Propertius, 4, 7, 7 (the dead Cynthia appearing to her lover ina
dream) -

eosdem habuit secum quibus est elata capillis, η
eosdem oculos; lateri vestis adusta fuir,

et solitum digito beryllon adederat ignis,
summaque lethaeus triverat ora liquor.

So wounds or any mutilation by which a man came to his death reappear ·
upon his shade in the other world or when he returns thence to appear
to usin our dreams, cp. eg. 2, 6, 39, Verg. A. 2, 274; 6, 450, 495, Ovid,
Met. ιο, 49, ιι,69ι,1 si1.1tal. 12, 547; etc. This nalve idea is universal.
We cannot disassociate the appearance of people in the other world
from their appearance in this world at death or aiter death and intermeat.
The risen Redeemer bears the scars oi his suiierings upon him, the ghost of
one foully murdered shows the gaping wound iorever dripping blood, he
wears white because the corpse traditionally wears white, he is pale because
the dead are pale, etc. The idea is firmly fixed among the Chiuese, and is
said to be the reason why they inflict such horrible mutilation upon their
criminals. See 1, 4, 6011.

38. obscuros . . . lacus: Edgar says in King Lem, 3, 6, Ἐιαῐειετιο calls
me; and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake os darkness.’
