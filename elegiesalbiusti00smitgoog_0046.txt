INTRODUCl'lON

Not less characteristic os the elegy as awhole is that dislilre
of war ¹to which our poet so often gives utteranee. Here how-
ever he represented the opinion of practieally every sane and
reasonable Roman who like himself had witnessed the car·
nival os violence and bloodshed from the death of Julius to
the accession oi Augustus. Somehave wondered at such senti-
ments from a man who was actually decorated for distinguished

service in the field, but the familiar and forcelul arraignment 1 -

of war attributed to the late General Sherman is proos enough
-it proos were necessary—that a horror of earnage is by no
means incompatible with the record os a ruthless and determined
fighter, where ruthless and determined fighting is the only path to
peace.

The poet fought, and fought well; but his motives appear to
have been his duty to his country and his personal loyalty to
Messalla. Temperamentally he was opposed to warfare. A
man of contemplation rather than of action, he could be quite
happy in his own society, and conversely had no wide and
absorbing interest in the people and events os the great world
about him. Neither necessity nor inclination prompted him to
enter politics, affairs, or any other of the beaten paths to wealth
and same.

It would be a mistake however to conclude, asso many seem
Ι to have done, that he had no ambitions at all. We may fairly
suspect that Tibullus belonged to a type more or less charac-
teristic of a period os high cultivation. He would be the last to
tell us that the one absorbing ambition os his life was the name
and farne of a great elegiae poet. Nor should we need to be

informed by him that such was the case. Artls-„tjg masterpieces
are-„notmwrittepnby, persons indifferent to lame· Indeed the
lact is betrayed, not only by his own works‚ but to a certain
extent perhaps by his attitude towards his contemporaries.
The circle os Messalla was distinctly favourable to elegy, our
