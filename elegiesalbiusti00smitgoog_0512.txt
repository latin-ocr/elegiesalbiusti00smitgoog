NOTES [4, 7, 9

lurnished two pages os writing suriaco, ke. the inside ol each tabella, and
the edge of each was slightly raised so asto prevent contact between the two
peges when the diptych was closed. The insertion os a third tabella made a
triptych,a book as it were of two covers and one leaf which furnished four
pages of writing sursace. To fasten tabellae together a cord was passed
through two or more holes in the lrarne and tied3 and it it was advisable or
necessary, a seal was attached, hence agnatis here. Either the diptych or the
triptych was regularly used lor love letters, as he're, cp. also 2, 6, 45; ovid,
Ars Amat. 1, 4373 Amor. 1, rr, 7; and osten. lt was customary sor the
recipient to use the same tabellae sor reply and thus return them to the
owner, cp. Catull. 42,; Propert. 3, 23; etc. They could then be cleaned and
used anew. Persons with a ‘beavy hand’ were apt to leave a permanent
record of former letters on the wood itsels‚ hence the force ol Ovid's warn-
ing, Ars Amat. 2, 395, ‘et quotiens scribes totas prius ipse tabellas Ι inspice:
plus multae quarn sibi missa legunt)

8. ne . . . nemo: the negative is doubled sor emphasis as in Greek, asin
Latin down to Catullus, and as always in the popular idiom of most languages.
In Latin itself the afterthought that two negatives make an affirmative holds
good only sor the classical period. Even then, however, poetry is sreer than
prose, and prose itself is l'ar from being without exceptions, cp. ag. Cicero,
Verr. 2, 60, ‘debebat Epicrates nummum nullum nemini'; Livy, 32, 26, 18;
43, r 3, r; Bell. Asr. 8; etc. Note too the-inherent tendency of all verbs
ol fearing to confuse negatives (Gildersleeve-Lodge, 553), 'non vereor ne
non,’ etc. and all through the Romance languages, ‘guardarsi di non credere,’
‘temo che non sia,’ etc. A close parallel to Sulpicia hereis Propert.2, 19,
32, ‘absenti nemo ne nocuisse velit: cp. also Ovid, Pont. r, r, 66, ‘ne non
peccarim mors quoque non faciet,' etc. where perhaps the Greek usage of
μὴ οὐ has badan influence.-quam meus ante: for the arrangement see
Propert. 2, 25, 26, ‘septima quam metam triverit ante rota’; 2, 18, 9, ‘illurn
saepe suis decedens fovit in undis Ι quam prius adiunctos sedula lavit equos,'

etc. antequam occurs only here in the Tibullian corpus, magisquom, 4, 7, 25 ,

priusquam, 1, 3, 35 ; potiusquam, 1, 1, 51. -meusz 1, 5, 42 n.

9. aed: ‘on the contrary! The opposition, however, os ‘sed . . . taedet’ is
not to the preceding distich as awhole, but to the thought suggested by ‘ signatis
ne . . .ante‚’ ie. the possible insinuation that her sear of discovery is due to
regret sor what she has done and to the lact that her desire sor secrecy is her
own choico-vultus componere famae: lit. ‘to conform appearance to
good report‚’ i.e. ‘to study the outward semblence in barmony with a sair
name.' componere of studied ellects in word or appearance is a favourite with
Tacitus, cp. eg. Ann. 1, 7, ‘salsi ac festinantes, vultuque composito ne laeti
