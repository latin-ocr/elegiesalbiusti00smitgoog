NOTES [1, 2, 252

mentioned together as here; Ovid, Ars Amat. 1, 137; Amor. 1, 4, 17-2o;
3, ιι, 23, Propera, 3, 8, 25, Anth. Pal. 5, 262, ι. So Naevius (75, R.)
says os a flirt, ‘quase in choro ludens datatim dat se et communem iacit. Ι alii
adnutat, alii adnictat‚ alium amat, alium tenet. Ι alibi manus est occupata,
alii percellit pedem, Ι anulum dat alii spectandum, a labris alium invocat, Ι

curn alio cantat, at tamen alii suo dat digito litteras'; -as the old play says, Ι

Ἀ lady that will wring one hythe lingent Whilst ou another's toes she
treads, and eries Ι “By gad, Ι love but one and you are he.”'

22. That is, conversing by a code oi signals prearranged or easily nuder-
stood, cp. the exx. just noted3 Ovid, Her. 17, 75 i.; Ars Amat. 1, 569 i.
Ovid, Amor. 1, 4, 23, suggests aiew details sor use at adiuuet, ‘siquid erit de
me tacita quod mente queraris, Ι pendeat extrema rnollis ab aure manus; Ι cum
tibi quae faciam, mea lux, dicamve placebunt, Ι versetur digitis anulus usque
tuis! Ι tange manu mensam tangunt quo more precantes, Ι optabis m'erito
curn mala multa viro!

25. tenebris: ‘in the dark,' an old and popular word ior night which
appears in all styles, eg. Petron. 37 where the lreedman gives the old proverb
as ⁸ mero meridie si dixerit illi tenebras esse, credet’ ; Titinius, 100 R., ‘noc-
tem sacere possit de die‚’ etc. For this ablat. oi time without an attribute cp.
ι, 6, 59, 2, 1, 76. The remaining exx. in Tibullus are pace, ι, ιο, 49 ; bisque
die, 1, 3, 31 (where we should expect in, see n). With an attribute, 24, etc.
Note thatin 1, 3, 67, in nocte profunda (where see note), and in 1, 1ο, 5ο, in
tenebris, the preposition (which appears only here with these words) indi·
cates that these two exx. were felt to be ablatives os place, 1, 1, 61 ιι, instead
of time. The same seems to be the case in the old proverb describing an
honest man as one, ‘quicum in tenebris mices' (Cic. Off. 3, 77; Fin. 2,
52 ; Petron. 44; etc.) where in is never omitted. This distinction however,
barriug such exceptions as in iuventute, in hoc tempore, and their like, holds
good only ior the classical period. The general idea oi the missing pentam-
eter is doubtless very well represented by any one oi various lines composed
by the early Humanists, eg. Aurispa‚ ‘securum iu tenebris me iacit esse
Venus'3 Seneca, ‘praesidio noctis sentio adesse deam'; Pontanus, ‘ille deus
certe dat mihi signa viae,' or, ‘usque meum custos ad latus haeret amor!

asa-26. For these nocturnal perils to the lover, Propertius, 3, 16, 5-2ο (a
passage having much in common with this); Ovid, Amor. 1, 6, 9; Eleg t'n
Maec. 1, 29, ‘nocte sub obscura quis te spoliavit amantem? {quis tetigit
ferro, durior ipse latus?’ Hor, Sat. 1, 2, 42; Antt. Pal. 5, 25; 213, 3;
Plaut. Amphit. 154.

For the dangers oi the Roman streets alter nightl'all, Sueton. Nero, 263
Tacitus, Anu. 13, 255 esp. Juv. 3, 302.
