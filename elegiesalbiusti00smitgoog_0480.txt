vulum ’3 cp. also Contra Faust. 22, 46.

⁹⁵·104· This rustic metm-making-the poet’s favourite theme- has much

See 2, 6, 8, ‘levem aquam) note ; Ovid‚ Met. rr, 6, ‘leves auras,’ etc.; Tib. r,
1, 73¹1·; 1, 7, 44·

97. oreste: 1, ro, 17 n.-umbracula: 2, 1, 24 n.

98. coronatus calix: it has been affirmed that this custom ol crowning
one's cup with flowers at feasts, etc, so osten mentioned by the Roman poets‚
is due to a literal but mistaken interpretation ol the Homeric κοῦροι μὲν κρη-
τῆροιτ ἐπεστέψαντο ποτοῖο, ιζι. ‘filled to the brim,’ not actually crowned with
flowers. See Leal on Iliad 1, 470, and cp. ό, 256.

roa. irrita facta velit: ‘the perf. infin. pass, generally with esse omitted,
is used after energetic expressions ol will (generally volo, less'olten nolo,
malo, cupio) in all periods As esse was usually omitted it was easier to take
eg. sacta here sora participle than lor an infinitiva—1, because the par·
ticiple is used osteuer than the infinitive, 2, because it is more characteristic
of the style in which the perfect infin. pass. aster volo, etc.,is native, 3, be·
cause the perf. part. pass. is older than its descendant the perf. infin. pass!
(Schmalz, Lat. Styl, etc„ 296). Hence the Romans of Quintilian’s time
parsed sacta here as a participle (cp, 9, 3, 9, ‘utimur . . . participio pro
verbo: “volo datum '' ’) irrespective of its origin or previous history.

103. suae: 1, 5, 42 n. To be taken with serus (not with plorabit as
