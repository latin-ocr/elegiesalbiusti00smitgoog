2, 3, 47] TIBVLLVS

47-48. The inexpensive though handsome ware of Samos ‚and Cumae,
generally red and often decorated in some way, was commonly used by many
Romans of the middle class who through moderate means or old-fashioned
conservatism did not incline to silver. Samian ware-the name describes
the type, not the place of manufacture—is according to circumstances an
illustration of miserliness (Plautus, Capt. ²915 Cicero, Mur. 36, 75), of pov·
erty (Plautus, Stich. 6943 Lucil. 445 Marx), or as here, of simplicity, cp. Rhet.
ad Herm. 4, 643 Auson. Epig. 8; Lactant. 1, 18, 21; Mart. 13, 7. The
ware of Cumae is highly praised by Pliny, 35, 164. These lines therefore are

a direct invitation to Nemesis to choose a simple life, ι“.ι. a life with the poet.
After a dramatic pause Tibullus, as if in response (49) to her wordless reply
in the negative, proceeds with his next point. It may be observed that this
association of simplicity and terra cotta had a long tradition in literature,
cp. eg. Bacchyl. frag. 21 Blass:

,06 βοῶν πάρεστι σώματ’, οὔτε χρυσός,
οὔτε πορφύρεοι τάπητες,
ἀλλὰ θυμὸς εὐμενής,

Μοῦσά τε γλυκεῖα, καὶ Βοιωτίοισιν
ἐν σκύφοισιν οἰνος ἡδύς.

47. trahant convivia= 1, 9, 61 n.

’ 48. lubrica terra: the adjective is peculiarly descriptive of wet clay in its
natural state.

49. heuheu: 2, 3, 2 n.

50-58. The poet is resigned to his fate.

51. luxuria fluat: ‘fluentes luxu,’ Livy, 7, 29, 5, ia cited by Stacey· as a
possible echo of this line. But Cicero, TuraDisput. 2, 52, had said ‘fluimus
mollitia: cp. Off. 1, 106, ‘diffluere luxuria,’ and 1, 7, 3 n.

52. incedat: especially used of a measured, prond, or graceful gait, of
walking as an accessory of beauty or dignity. A favourite word with Proper·
tius, cp. 2, 2, 5, ‘fulva coma est longaeque manus, et maxima toto Ι corpore,
et incedit vel Iove digna soror, l aut cum Munychias Pallas spatiatur ad aras,’
etc.; op. Verg. A. r,46', ‘ast ego qnae divom incedo regina'; Propert. 3,13,
11, ‘matrona incedit census induta nepotum Ι et spolia opprobrii nostra per
ora trahit’ ; 2, 1, 5, ‘sive illam Cois fulgentem incedere cogis,' where the
reference is to 1, 2, 1, ‘quid iuvat ornato procedere, vita, capillo Ι et tennes
Coa veste movere sinus?’ procedo is esp. used of women who don their
finery and go out, cp. 4, 2, 113 Ovid, Ars Amat. 3, 165, ‘femina procedit
densissima crinibus emptis,’ etc. For prodire in the same sense, 1, 9, 70 n.;
Ovid, Ars Amat. 3, 131 (with Brandt’s n.); Lultian, Dialog. Mer. 6, 2, etc.
