9-10. The anaphora -Ι- chiasmus is characteristic of Ovid, cp. Amor. a, 5,
43, ‘spectabat terram: terram spectare decebat: Ι maesta erat in vultu:
maesta decenter erat ’3 Ars Amat. 1, 195, ⁴ cum tibi sint fratres, fratres ulcis·
cere laesos 1 cumque pater tibi sit, iura tuere patris ’; 2, 2973 3033 199 ; etc.
In 11—12 (as often in ovid) the poet returns to parallelism.

Note that the arrangement of the theme in 9-12 is also chiastic-9, no
coiffure, rie. indoor costuma (1, 3, 91-92 n.) and simplicity, as contrasted with
ιο, elaborate coiffure, aie. outdoor costume (eg. Propert. 1, 2, 1, 'quid iuvat
ornato procedere, vita, capillo, Ι et teneras Coa veste movere sinust’ etc.)
and artz' 11, the palla and brilliant colours, i.e. outdoor costume and art
(procedere, 2, 3, 52 ιι.), 12, plain white, ale. lndoor costuma and simplicity.

11-12. voluit. . . venit: for the shift of tense cp. 1, 1, 24 ιι.

ιι. palla: regularly worn on the street by the Roman women. The
palla worn by the gods (ι, 7, 46 ιι.) and by lritharoidoi (2, 5, 7 ιι.) was of
another type. Tyria suggests, though not necessarily, the festive occasion,
see 15 below. The omission of cum with the ablative of attendance is found
only here in Tib. (1, 10, 27 n). In such cases the noun is accompanied as
here by an attribute.

ra. venit: 1, 2, 76 ιι.

1³· Vertumnus: a comparison frequently made in this connection. The
aptness of it is due to the fact that Vertumnus could assume any attractive
form he chose, cp. esp. Propert. 4, a, 21 f.; Ovid‚ Met. 14, ⁶423 etc.

14. Burton (tc. in 7-10 n.) quotes this line and adds ‘ Let her wear what
she will, do what she will, say what she will,

quidquid enirn dicit, seu facit, omne decet.

He applauds and admires everything she wears, saith, or doth.’ -miller ι, 3,

o n.
⁵ 15-20. For these standard illustrationis of luxury and expense in female
costume (Tyrian stufls, Oriental perfumes, iewels) see 2, 4, ²7-30 and notes.

¹5· digna est cui: 1, 5, 1311.

16. bis madefactat 2, 3, 57-58 ιι. Tbe ordinary prose word is dibapha.
The poet means to indicate the best and most expensive of Tyrian stuffs (so also .
Ilor. Epod. 12, 213 Od. a, 16, 353 Cicero, Fam. 2, 16, 7, eta), but this was
really a survival from earlier conditions and a different point of view, cp. eg.
Pliny, 9, 137, written about a century later. He quotes Cornelius Nepos
(died ίιι the reign of Augustus) for the statement that in his boyhood, ‘vio-
