NOTES [4, 7, 7

1—2. That is, ‘sit mihi'sama pudori magis texisse quam nudasse alicui

qualem amorem,’ ‘and such a love — the report that l bave concealed it would
shsme me rather than that I have disclosed it to some one.’-pttdori stt
mihi: 1, 5, 29.

3. illum: Dissen’s contentiou that illum: Amor above, ie. 'ardor ama·
torius curn gaudiis suis,' isnot supported by bis citation t'rom Pind. Nem. 8, „
6, nor by his objection that Cerinthus is not named in the poem. For a
young person in Sulpicia’s state oi mind there can he but one ‘him,' cp.
meus below. Besides she is intentionally indefinite. -Cythereer 1, 3, 58 n.
-Cameulsr ie. ‘songs,' ‘verses’ though here as elsewhere the personifica-
tion (cp. exorata) is clearly t'elt, ep. Pan. Messal. 24 and 192. Rare outside
ot Horace (od. 1, 12, 393 4, 6, ²7³ 9, 83 Epist. 1,1, r; 1, 19, 53 A. P.
275). Elsewhere in the elegy only Ovid, Pone. 4, 13, 33. The model is the
similar use osteodes in Greek, cp. Pind. Nem. 3, 493 Aison· Eumen. 3083
etc.

4. attuu, etc: ‘brought him to my arms and laid him there! For this
function oi Venus see 1, 8, 35 and 1, 3, 58 n. afferre does not talre in 1-
accus. except with comitium, senatum, and the like, where ‘into' is obviously
needed to express the idea. The regular cous. is ad ÷ accus. The regular
cons. with deponere is in 1- ablat. Finally neither verb can take the regular
cons. ot' the other and retain the meaning demanded here. The choice oi
in -t- aecus. here is justified by the t'act that both verbs are really coincident
and represent a single action (⁸ brought and put ¹) and that in sinum is not
only naturally suggested by the complex, but also hy the fact that the original
and literal meaning oi sinus (ie. ‘a iold,' cp. 1, 3, 6, etc.) encourages it in
the derived meanings to stand in the accus. with in (‘into’) aiter verbs oi
approaching, cp. 4, 3, 24³ Ovid, Her. 13, 1483 Met. 4, 5965 eto-sinum:
we shortld say ‘arms’ in a case like this, cp. 4, 3, 24; Lygd. 3, 3,8; Ovid,
Ars Amat. 2, 360; Her. 3, tt4; 13, 157; Mel. 4, 596; etc.

6. sua: scgaudia. The natve imprecation ‘mea gaudia . . . sue' might
seems contradiction oi 1-2. The subjunctives sit, velim, seror (2, 8, and
to), however, represent Sulpicia’s inclinationi, not her intentioris. ,

708. ‘l could wish thatI might never seal one letter to my love because
I feared that any one, I care not who, would read it first! -non: goes with

mandare not with velim, and the clause ‘ne . . . ante’ depends upon ‘sig-
natis . . . tabellis,' more esp. upon ‘signatis' That is, ‘l have to seul my
letters to him ior sear of discovery. How 1 wish no such necessity existed!
1 am so proud ol my love and my lover, so happy in them both, thatl

¹ would it were lrnown to all the worlrl l’ These lines are prominent in the

old discussion of ‘ F eminine Latinity,’ and their undeniable difficulty has been
