Nouus ' [r. 5, 43

7, 27 (an elegy suggested by this motive), ‘num mea Thessalico languent
devota veneno Ι corpora? num misero carnren et herba nocent, Ι sagave poeni·
cea defixit nomina cera Ι et medium tenuis in iecur egit acusi’ etc, and again
79, ‘aut te traiectis Aeaea venefica lanis Ι devovet, aut alio lassus amor venis’

(in which as we learn from actual defixiones Ovid is alluding to the most com· ·
mon methodos procedure); Herod. 2, 181 ς often in the witch trials of the
tilieenth and sixteenth centurias, etc. See esp. J. Hansen, Quellen und
Unterruchungen aur Geschichte des Hexenwahns und 'der llexmversraigung im
Mittelalter, Bonn, 1901, pp. 44, 97; 138; 14²5 276} 283, etc.

42. et pudet et narrat: the phrase appears to be supported and sufficiently
explained by Ovid, Rem. Amor. 407, ‘et pudet et dicam,' lit. ‘I am ashamed
and at the same time 1 will say,’ ‘1 say it with shame,’ ie. ‘I am ashamed to
say it but Iwill'; Met. 14, 279, ‘et pudet et referam’; Pont. 4, ις, 29, ‘et
pudet et metuor.’ ‘And she is piqued and 12 telling,’ etc. ‘In her pique
she is telling that my mistress knows: etc. devotum 12 what she told
Tibullus, the pentameter 12 the expansion ol it which she retailed to others*—
nofanda: things accursed, too awful to be mentioned, ie. la science maudite,
the black art. The impressively indefinite word suggests in itseli the attitude
ol the gossip at the time-meam: sc. puellam or dominam, so 1, 4, 75;
2,5, 1035 2, 6, 5²3 4, 7,8; Propert. 1, 9. 22; Catull. 3, 6, etc. Thisuseoi
the possessive pronoun though occasional in the elegy is ,more characteristic
oi the popular sphere. So ipse, ipsa (Greek αὐτός) of the master or mistress,
as in Terence, Anat 360 ς Plaut Casina, 790 ; Verg. E: 3, 3 ; Catull. 64, 43;
Ovid, Met. 2, 390 (01 Jupiter), Trist.5, 11, tl ; Petron. 63 (ipsimi nostri);
etc.

43-46. Reply to the gossip ο1 42. ‘Yes, Delia has laid me under a charm
(devovet, cp. devotum, 41) —but the charmis her beauty.' For the descrip-
tion of Delia’s charms see Introd. p. 48, The passage is echoed by Luigi
Alamanni, in his elegy, ‘Ben mi credia poter senz’ altra cura,’ etc.

43-44. ‘C'est une nouvelle preuve que les semines sont grandes ennemies
de la science,’ remarks the inimitable Jerome Coignard (Anatole France, la
Ritisserie de la Reine Pe'dauque, p. 5 5) when these lines are quoted against
himin an argument. Tibullus gives a skiliul turn to the old question ο1 the
comparative merits of beauty and magic in a love allair. For another, 1,
8,23. Afranius says (378 R., cp. Menander, 646 Κ.) ‘si possent homines
delenimentis capi, Ι omnes haberent nunc amatores anus. Ι aetas et corpus
tenerum et morigeratio, Ι haec sunt venena formosarum mulierum: {mala
aetas nulla delenimenta invenit.¹ When Olympias had seen aud conversed
with 2 rival who had been aecused ο1 winning Philip's affectione by witch-
craft, she is reported to have dismissed her with the remark (Plutarch, Mor.
