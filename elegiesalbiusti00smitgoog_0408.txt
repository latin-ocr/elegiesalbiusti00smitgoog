51. That is, on feast days in the spring and fall, the only times when he had
leisure and also occasion to develop in the direction indicated. Aristotle says
(Eth. Nik. 8, 9, 6), αί γὰρ ἀρχαῖαι θυσίαι καί σύνοδοι φαίνονται ’γίνεσθαι μετὰ τὰς
τῶν καρπῶν amramitis, οἷον ἀπαρχαί · μάλιστα γὰρ ἐν τούτοις ἐσχόλαζον τοῖς
καιροῖς, see also Hor. Epist. 2, 1, 139, etc.

52. certo pede: the development of regular rhythm in song which was ,

followed hythe invention of an instrument by which it might be accompanied .

when sung to the gods in their holiday attire (ornatos), ie. on feast days,
cp· 1, 7. 4a54 οι 2. 1‚3; etc· ’

53. That is, the fistula or syrinx, described more particularly in 2, 5, 31. In
Greek mythology its invention was ascribed to Pan (story in Ovid, Met. 1,
690). Hence its modern name of ‘Pan's pipe.' The line itself issuggestive
of Vergil, E. 1, 2, ‘silvestrem tenui Musam meditaris avena,’ which is variously
imitated by the later poeta.

55. Hereasin 1, ι, 17 and 1, 7, 5-8 (see notes) the use of red paint was
ceremonial. On this primitive ancestor of the mask‚ which was afterwards
used in the old satyr drama (from which the tragedy in its artistic form was
finally developed) see Diomedes above. lf Tibullus was thinking of a similar
use of wine lees in this connection he followed Horace, A. P. 275, in confusing
the origins of comedy with those of tragedy.

5⁶. ab arte: 1, 5, 4 n. —chorosr i.e. the combination of dancing with
the music and poetry which had previously been developed. The poetis
probably thinking ofthe dithyramb, to which Aristotle rightly traced the
origin of tragedy (Poet. 4).

57-58. Tibullus evidently has in mind the conventional explanation of
τράγος in tragoedia as the goat given as a prize to the victorious poet. It
was also accepted by Horace, A. P. 220, cp, too, Dioskorides, Anth. Pal. 7,
410, and the first sentence of Diomedes quoted above. Tne explanation
now generally accepted is that τράγος refers rather to the costume of the
actors in the primitive satyr drama, cp. Aisch. frag. 207 N.; Etymol. Mag.
764, 6, τραγῳδία ὅτι τὰπολλὰ σί χοροί ἐκ Σατύρων συνίσταντο, οὓς ἐκάλουν
τράγους. iliad no tradition of this explanation in the Roman writers.
Among recent discussions of this subject see esp. A. Dieterioh, ‘Entstehung
der Tragddie‚’ Archiv fi Religionswissensclrast, 1908, p. 163, ff.

Here, of course, dux pecoris=lrircus. For this generic use of ovile
(‘goat-house’ as well as ‘sheep-fold') cp. eg. Ovid, Met. 13, 828, ‘sunt,
