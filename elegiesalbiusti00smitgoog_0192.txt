NOTES [1, 1, 9

01 the route without a preposition—really instrumental, see note on auro,
line 1 above —with a verb of motion. Schulze cites Livy, 23, 24, 7, ‘silva
qua exercitum traducturus erat.¹ The construction (mainly old-fashioned or
poetic) is not common, and extension to the sphere of metaphoris usually
supported as here hyan adjective..

6. Referred to by Statius, Silvae, 1, 2, 255, ‘divesque foco lucente Ti·
bullus,' and imitated in au ancient epitaph (Carne. Epig. 477, ιο), ‘tunc
1111111 adsidue semper bene luxit, amice, focus’ Theline is also quoted by
three of the ancient grammarians.

The touch is characteristic of antiquity. The practical and sacred associa-
tions of the hearth and the hearth lire made them synonymous with home and
home life, cp. the ‘focus perennis’ of Mart. 10, 47, 4, also 2, 90, 7-1o; T 111011-
ritos, 11, 51 (the well-todo but unattractive Kyklops to his Galatea), al
δέ τοι αὐτὸς ἐγὼν δοκέον λοσιώτερος ᾖμεν, Ι tart δρυὸς ξύλο μοι 1011111010δῷ
ἀκάματον κῦρε Aristoph. Pax 440 (the farmer’s ideal of comfort), μὰ Δι’, ἀλλ’
ἐν εἰρήνῃ διαγαγεῖν τὸν βίον, Ι 1χονὸ ἑτοὶρον sal σκαλεύοντ’ ἄνθρακος. Home
is no home without it, Mart. 11, 56, 4, ‘ et tristis nullo qui tepet igne focus, ’
Ovid, Trisl. 1, 3, 44, going 11110 exile, speaks of his ‘exstinctos focos,’ cp.
Aisch. Choeplr. 629, τίω 11 ἀθέρμαντον &ortas δόμων. Η1 who has 11011111
poor indeed, Catullus, 2311111 Martial's imit. 11, 32.

7. ipse: i.e. in person, which would be unusual in one of Tibullus’s
position and emphasizes the old Roman simplicity of the lot preferred, cp. 1,
‚²⁹ 71 ; 2, 6, 8 and the parallel of this passage in Propert. 3, 17, 15 ff. -tenerasr
contrasted with grandia, see lntrod. p. 103. 111 fact grandia is better as a
contrast than asan epithet of young fruit trees.

8. facili: ae. ‘ready,' ‘slrilful’ cp. manu sollerti, 1, 7, 29. The shift of
adjectives from a usual passive 1ο an unusual active or vice versa 11 a fre-
quent and characteristic device of poetry, cp. pigra, 1, 2, 293 igyrolis, 1,
3, 33 tardas, 1, 3, 161 tristia, 1, 5, 5⁰³ fertilis, 1, 7, 223 felicibus, 2, 1, 25;
securo and sobria, 2, 1, 463 naufraga, 2, 4, 103 inulla, 1, 6, 481 innoxia,
2, 5, 63; amor, 1, 4, 10 (see note), etc—poma: for pomos, cp. 2, 1, 43,
‘fruit trees.’ On antique methods 01 planting vineyards and orchards see,
eg.. Varro, De Re Rust. 1, 7; Columella, 3, 13.

9. spes: not the goddess, though, as the verbs show, personilied 101 the
moment. Hope and the husbandman are frequently associated; cp. 2, 6,
2ο ff.. and notes-destituat: usually destitui spe ora spe. The absolute
us'e as here is so rare that Livy, 1, 41, 1, ‘si destituat spes,' hasbeen called a
reminiscence, cp. 37, 7, 9, ‘si is destituat’3 45, 2ο, 3, ‘spe destituta';
Lucan, 2, 728, ‘triumphis destituit Fortuna tuis’ (so G, i.e. Ms. Bruxeliensis
53303 see Hosius's tert); 5, 298, ⁶ quando pietasque fidesque destituunt)
