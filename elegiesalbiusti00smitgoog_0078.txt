INTRODUCTION

just what Quintilian described him to be, ‘tersus atque elegans
maxime,' or as Sellar puts it, ‘in his art the most faultless, the
most perfectly harmonious.’

’ Comparisons however are more οτ less futile, and are osten mis·
leading. The three poets are really complementary rather than
parallel. The unique genius of Propertius, the sparkle, the
creative imagination, of Ovid, the Hellenic symmetry and reserve

have been the only one known to the Roman public until some
time after the reign of Domitian. It has also been suggested that
the same edition was used by the later grammarians or by their
authorities-at any rate all their citations are confined to the
first two books. So too certain old library catalogues would ap-

of it survived until well into the Middle Ages

The text however which we know, and which was known to the
early mediaeval excerptors, is descended from another edition to
which a number of poems had been added, either asan appendix
to book 2 or as a third book. The further subdivision of this ap·

the Italian scholars of the fifteentb century, and has uo authority in
tradition. Who was the editor of this collection? When was it
incorporated with Tibullus? Had it ever been published before,
either in part οτ as a whole? Who and what were the authors of
the various pieces? These are all questions which have been dis-
