Otherwise we may develop the thought in one or two principal
ways.1

1. Division of the idea into parts, unsolding it in continuous
sentences and clauses. ¹Characteristic oi Tibullus, aud in a
disserent form, of Ovid. See Tib. 1, 1, 1-2 ; 3-43 9-103 11-
12, etc. This device runs through the elegy, and makes for
simplicity.

II. Amplification by repetition of the same idea indifferent
forms. Characteristic ol Propertius and, in a different way, of
Ovid. This device-one of the best known and most common in
’ rhetoric-is of course used in various ways, eg. positive, then neg·
ative; literal‚ then figurative3 general, then particular, etc. The
hexameter loreshadows the pentameter (hence the point ol the
epigram is osten in the pentameter), or the pentameter remodels
the hexameter, and adds something to it, comments on it, merely
echoes it lor emphasis, etc, etc. Compare, e.g., Tib. 1, 1, 39-40 ;
43-443 55-5⁶; ovid‚Am0r.1‚9‚ 1-2 3 3-43 21-22 3 25-2⁶;
31-32; 35·3⁶3 41-42·

Il the distich is filled by a single sentence, it is usual to divide
subject and predicate in some artistic way between t'he two
verses. For example we should avoid ending the grammatical con-
struction with 'the hexameter. ln this way the two verses are at
once united and distinguished. Compare Tib. 1, 1, 19-20 ; 23-
243 31-32 3 33·34 ; 35-36‚ etc·

Again a clause depending on an adjective or participle and ' .
nearly or quite filling the pentameter is taclred on the sentence.
Very characteristic os Propertius ; cp. 1, 1, 1-a 3 2, 19—'2o‚ etc.
So even ol an entire distich, cp. 1, 15, 25-29. The habit reflects
his highly emotional strain. The pentameter is a sigh, an ech0‚ an
alterthought‚ a comment. Emotion is not periodic. Il it must
express itself in long sentences, they naturally take such forms as
these. The only cases in Tibullus are 1, 5, 13-14 3 1, 7, 2 f.; 1,
7, 28 f. 3 1, 8, 7²3 2,5, 24, butall have the subject orobjectol the
