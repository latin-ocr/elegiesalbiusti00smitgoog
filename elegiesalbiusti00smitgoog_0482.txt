try. The use of laurel iu triumphs as here is often mentioned. Like the
phallus, the rihald songs of the soldiers, and the triumphator's purple robe,
the laurei was prophylactic. There were spirits abroad and it was for protec-
tion against them that these precautions were taken. The fact, as Ogle ob·
serves (A. J. P. 31, 292) that the soldiers also wore laurei suggests that the
spirits most feared were the avenging‘ ghosts of tbe warriors slain in battle
(and so Masurius in Pliny, 15, t 35) . -iauro amoti: so Pliny, 15, 133, ‘ Ro-
manis praecipue laetitiae victoriarumque nuntia additur litteris et militum lan·
ceis pilisque fasces imperatorum decorat! The triumphator himself used the
‘Delphico laurus,’ cp. Pliny, 15, 127.

Tibullus addresses this elegy to his friend Macer, probably the poet Aemilius
Macer of Verona (cp. 1 n. and Introd. p. 53).

‘Macer is off to the wars. What is to become of Love? Can he trail the
puissant pike? Will he shoulder his kit, drop into line, and trudge along
beside his friend? Fetch back the deserter, boy, make the hardened recre-
ant smart for his defection! Or, do you spare those who juin the ranks of
Mars? If so, bere is another recruit, able-bodied and quite willing to wait ou
himself. Venus and the girls may go their way and-be welcome. 1 don’t
mind fighting at all, Ι enioy it!

‘Hear me boast! And the mighty words die on my lips at the mere sight
of her closed door. How oflen I have sworn by all the powers, never, never
to return, and then my feet have always walked straight back! Cruel Love,
would that your arrows were broken and your torches put out. You torture
me, you drive me to dreadful blasphemies. i would have put an end to my
misery ere now were it not that Hope bids me live. ⁴⁴ To-morrow,” she always
says, “ to·morrow will be better.” Hope is the optimist, we all hope for some·
thing! The farmer hopes for a crop, else why should he sow, the prisoner
for freedom, else why should he sing to the clank of his chains, the fisherman
