INTRODUCTION

The same may be said of the occasioual traces of prosaic or¹
conversational usage (ag. ‘curn digno digna,’ 4, 7, 105 the double
dative, 4, 7, 2 ; the double negative, 4, 7, 8; the zeugma, 4, 7, 43
the use of ‘quiescas' 4, 8, 5 3 ‘quamvis' with the indic, 4, 8, 83
the meaning of ‘cadam,' 4, ro, 23 ‘aeque ac' with a sentence,
4, 12, 1-2). The majority of these occur in other poets, and
the remainder cannot be called distinctively feminine. So too 0f
an occasional vagueness or laclr of strict logical connection
in the construction ofa sentence (see 4, 9, 4 ; 4, 10, 5, and
notes), an occasional awkwardness in the formation of a distich,
etc. A sufficient explanation of these and similar peculiarities
is mere inexperience in literary and metrical technique. Inex·
perience in such matters is not distinctively feminine.

Irrespective however of training, of environment, or of any
extraneous cause, mere sex in itself is clearly reflected in
habits of thought and points of view. Α genuine woman reacts
so to speak to a given emotional stimulus in a way more or
less characteristic of every other genuine woman in the same
situation. In this respect nothing in all literature could be more
characteristically feminine than these elegies Their charming
author is beyond all doubt a very woman. It is really for that
reason that her poetry is undeniably so difficult. Her way of
thinking is distinctively feminine, and though we may be familiar
with itin the modern sphere of our own persoual experienee,
it is less easy to follow in Latin, because Latin as we know it
in the surviving literature is distinctively and exclusively mas-
culine. She is feminine in what she says and in the way she
says it. On the other hand, and this is the real difficulty, she
is quite as feminine in what she does not say.

The present arrangement-of the poems was evidently based
'¹ upon the usual plan of variety and importanee, not upon chrono-
logical sequence. 4, 7, by which the series is introduced, really
marks the culmination of the affair. Chronologieally, or at least
psychologically, the order is 4, 12; 4, 10; 4, 75 and as these
