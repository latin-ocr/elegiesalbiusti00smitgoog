NOTES [1, 3, 5

that whatever liberties we may talre with the beginning of a verse the type of
it must be clearly marked at the close. For this as well as for other reasons
the law of ‘ conllict’ (1, 2, 27 n.) in the first four feet of the hexameter yields
to the law of ⁶ agreement’ in the last two. ln that case (irrespective of spon·
daie lines which as they do not occur in Tib. need not be considered here)
the verse must end iu a dissyllable or 1 trisyllable preceded by 1 single word
beginning not later than the fifth thesis nor earlier than the fourth arsis, thus,

datadedissern’; 1,‘Messalla, per undas’3 25, ‘pureque lavari’ ; 61,‘totosque
per agros' ; 47, ‘ bella, nec ensem’; 77, ‘stagnaz sed acrem! More than 90⁰)⁰
of all the Roman hexameters surviving conform to tbis rule. The possible
cadences remaining 111 involve some Ι101111111 ’ and are all exceptional. Agrae-
ably therefore to the laws of chronology andos department (see Introd. p. 96)
they are most common in the early poets and the satire, least common in
the elegy. Of these exceptional cadences, 'hic mihi mater,' ie. 1 monosylla-
ble followed by two dissyllables (where the monosyllnble softens as much as
possible the objectionable conllict in the fifth foot) is decidedly the favourite
with Tibullus (r, 2, 95, see n.; 1, 2,41; 3, 5; 3, 233 6, 33; 6, 573 9, ¹¹3
12111151051115115,61;6,3;6,1;6,11;4.1,15;5,1),
111110 with Propertius (1411111111 less with Ovid wbo reduces all excep
tional usage to a minimum (only three exx. in the Amores, 1, 4, 673 2, 13, 53
2,17, 21). As a rule, the first dissyllable is like ntihi here, more or less
enclitic or proclitlc in its nature. On the contrary, in five cases (1, 6, 13 6,
63 ; 2, 4, 45; 4, 59 ; ς, 111 -not mentioned above) Tib. neglecta the lew of
the monosyllable (only once, 2, 23, 15, in Propertius, never in Ovid, Amores).
To end the hexameter with a monosyllable was always bad. lt was least
objectionable, however, when the last foot was filled out with another mono-
syllable, thus, 1, 4, 63, ‘carmina ni sint’ (the only ex. in Tib.); cp. Sulpicia, 4,
11, 5, and only four times-in Ovid, Amores (1, 15, 5; 2,4, 13; 3, 4, 5; 7, 55).
· With Propertius, however, this is the decided favourite among exceptional
endenses (25 cxx).
The cadence represented by ‘exhibitura puellis’ occurs 19 times in Proper·
tius, 11 times in Ovid, Amores, but only 3 times in Tibullus, all iu the second
, book (1, 61; 3, 733 5, 93). The following exceptional cadences occur in
Propertius, but not in Tibullus nor Ovid-2, 3, 45, ‘aut mihi si quis' (cp.
Sulpicia, 4, 10, 1); 2, 24, 51, ‘potins precor ut me'; 2, 27, 11 ; 3‚1,9; 3, 8,
33 3, 9, 593 4, 5,17; ‘sub limine amor qui,’ 2, 25, 17 (cp. the Vergilian ‘prae-
ruptus aquae mons’); 'mercede hyacinthos,’ 4, 7, 33; ‘Oricia terebintho' (cp. '
the Vergilian ‘nitens elephanto ’); ‘fors et in hora,’ 2, 9, 1; 3, 4, 19 ; ‘increpi-
tarent,’ 2, 26, 15; 1, 8, 35 (characteristic of Lucretius and the early poets).
