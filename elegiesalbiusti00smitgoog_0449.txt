was largely due to the fact that the splendid temple on the Palatine (line 1;
Propert. 2, 315 4, 6; Hor. C arm. Saec. 65, 616.) which was built by the Emperor,
and on Oet. 9, 28 116. dedicated by him, was a thanlr offering to his divine i
patron (and, as many believed, his own father) for the victory at Actium

(Propert. 4, 6, 616.) and for the restoration of peace and stability for which χ
men had been longing (Hor. Od. 1, 2, etc.) ever since the death of the great ¹
Dictator. =
All the various Sibyla (67—80 n.) were closely associated with Apollo and his ³
worship, and it was universally believed that their prophecies were inspired by
him (15 11). Hence the sripreme importance attached to the Libri Sibyllini

from the first appearance of them together with the worship of Apollo himself ¹

until nearly the fall 01 166 Western Empire. The books of Oracula which, ac·
cordingto the well-known story (Servius on Verg.A.6, 72, etc), Tarquin bought
of the Sibyl Amalthea were deposited by him 111 a stone chest underneath the
t'emple 01 Jupiter Capitolinus. Here they remained until their destruction at
the burning 01 166 temple in 83 tac. The temple was rebuilt in 78 se. Two
years after, the Senate (Lactant. Dia. 1, 6, 4) sent a commission to Erythrae
and to various other cities of Italy, Sicily, and Africa (Tac. Ann. 6, 12) to

collect whatever Sibylline oracles might still 66 in existence. About 1000 3

verses, for the most part derived from individuals, were brought back to Rome.
After careful sifting the residuum was placed in the new Capitol. Later, this
residuum was again revised hy Augustus, and, at the same time, nearly 2000

600115 01 eracles, then current among the people,'were examined. Whatever ’
was considered genuine was transcribed by the X Vviri and deposited in two l

coffers under the statue 01 166 Palatine Apollo. The remainder was burned.

Ι According to Suetonius, Aug. 31, this toolr place in 12 sc. when Augustus

became pontifex maximus, but from this poem, line 17 1. (cp. Cassius Dio, 54,
17 ; Verg. A. 6, 72), 11 15 clear that the date was certainly previous to 19 se.
A similar inquisition 01 166 Sibylline oracles was made by Tiberius 111 19 AD.
(Cassius Dio, 57, 18) and again in 32 AD. (Tac. Ann. 6, 12). 111 363 AD.
they were still in the temple on the Palatine (Ammian. Marcell. 23, 3), 6111
soon after 40⁰ they were finally destroyed by Stilicho (Rutilius, De Red. 2, 51,

etc). The extant collection known as the Oracula Sibyllina has little or ,

nothing to do with the old Libri Sibyllini.

The Libri Sibyllini were looked upon and used, not as a collection 01
prophecies of the future, but rather as an authority for the course to be pur-
sued in the case ο1 special and dreadful prodigia (Cicero, Div. 2, 112, etc.)
not otherwise provided for. They were, therefore, consulted only on rare
occasions. ’1116 care of them was originally intrusted to a board of two
