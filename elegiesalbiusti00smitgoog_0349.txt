linguam ne rigeant; careant rubigine dentes!
nec vagus in laxa pes tibi pelle natet,

nec male deformet rigidos tonsura capillos;
sit coma, sit scita barba resecta manu;

et nihil emineant et sint sine sordibus ungues,
inque cava nullus stet tibi nare pilus;

nec male odorati sit tristis anhelitus oris,
nec laedat naris virque paterque gregis!

cetera lascivae faciant concede puellae
et siquis male vir quaerit habere virum.

ovid, Ars Amat. 3, 101.

One observes at once that Marathus overdresses-which indicates his
position ; and that he is too feminine in his tastes — which indicates the puer
delicatus. All which of course helps to mark this affair, as the poet intended
it to do, as a tragedy oi high life below stairs.

The resemblance to our passage os Paul. Silent.Anrh.Pa1. 5, 228, seems
too close to be a matter oi mere accident—-

litet τίνι κλέξεις ἔτι βόστρυχον, ἢ τίνι χεΐρος
φαιδρυνέεις ὀνύχων ἀμφιτεμὼν ἀκίδος

ἐς τί δὲ κοομήοεις illuviei* φάρεα κόχλῳ,
μηκέτι τῆς καλῆς ἐγγὺς ἰὼν Ῥοδόπης ;

ὄμμασιν οἷς Ῥοδόπην οὐ δέρκομαι, οὐδὲ φαεινῆς
φέγγος ἰδεῖν ἐθέλω χρύσεον Ἠρκπδλης.

9-10. The ancients‚ partly no doubt because they went bareheaded as a
rule (and the same is true of the modern Neapolitana), devoted a great deal
of attention to dressing their hair, cp. egr. 1, 6, 39-40 n.; t, 9, 67.

Marathus being a slave wore his hair long (1, 4, 37-38 n.)‚ moreover as a
puer delicatus he apes the feminine style of coiffure and adopts the feminine
point of view with regard to it. Τοο much attention to the hair (Ovid, Ars
Amat. 1, 505 f. quoted above) was ol course in bad taste and characterized the

¹ overdressed exquisite oi 1, 6, 39 (cp. note ad loc.,· Ovid, Ars Amat. 3, 433,
eto). The use of curling tongs was especially affected by persons oi the
Marathus type, cp. Plautus, Asin. 627, ‘cinaede calamistrate’3 Curc. 577 ;
Cicero, Red. 12, ‘cincinnatus ganeo‘; Sest. 18. ‘unguentis adfluens, cala·
mistrata coma'; etc.

9. quid prodest: for the implication, ie. your object was to win the girl,
see 1, 9, 67-70 n.
