1, 7, 1] TIBVLLVS

well be the same that about two thousand years ago were furnisbed to our
agreeahle and distinguished travellers. Iasked my guide whether this was not
actually the fact, at the same time giving him as good a description as 1 could
of the two Romans; and his denial of the imputation was so wealr that my
guess has now become almost a certainty*

¹ ‘This day was to rout the bordes of Aquitania, so sang the fatal Spinners
whose threads no god can unwind. Their words *have come true and Rome

has seen the glorious triumph of Messalla. All Aquitania bears witness to ,

his fame, Cydnus, too, and Taurus, Palestine, Tyre, the mighty river with the
summer floods. Where dost thou hide thy head, Father Nile? Thanlrs to
thee, thy land makes no prayers to the great god of rain. Of thee thy strange
people sing, and of Osiris, who first tilled the field and planted the orchard,
who discovered the vine and first expressed the juice ol the grape that drives
all care away. Sorrow and trouble have nought to do with thee, Osiris, but
always dance and song and lightsome love, flowers and musicand festal attire.
Come then and join with us in doing honour to the birthday of Messalla
May his children add lustre to his fame and be with him in his old age. Nor
shall his road, the enduring monument of an honest contractor, be forgotten
by Tusculum and Alba. The farmer who comes home in the dark without
stumbling shall call down blessings upon your head. May every birthday be
happier than the lastt'

1-2. The web of every man’s lile iswoven by Destiny at the hour of his
birth. This idea appears as early as Homer (cp. Odyss. 7,196; Seneca, Oed.

98o; etc.) and is still firmly fixed in the consciousness of the Mediterranean ,
taces. The Parcae (regularly identified with the Moirai) frequently perform y
this function in the Roman poets and are therefore represented in art with the g
volumen and the spindle. The accompaniment of prophetie song appears “ ,
first in the tale os Meleager (Ovid, Met. 8, 4523 Apollod. 1, 8, 2; Pausan. ro, ζ
31, 4), also at the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (Catullus, 64, 323, froma ¹

Greek source), etc. Cp. 4, 5, 3 ; Verg. E. 4, 473 Ovid, Trist. 5, 3, 25, etc.

2. dissoliientla: so 40 below, the only other case in Tibullus. Diaeresis 3
with solvo and its componnds is not uncommon in the poets, though never t

in Propertius and not quoted for Ovid.

3. hunc: sc. diem. For the figure cp. eg. Propert. 1, 13, 25, ‘una dies r

omnis potuit praecurrere amores,' etc., i.e. the day does the deeds of him that
was born upon it.—Aquitanas gentes: the Aquitania of Caesar lay between ¹
the Garonne, the Pyrenees, and the Bay of Biscay. It therefore corresponded
generally to the Gascony and the Bearn of old France—fundere gentes:
one of the numerous metaphors from verbs of pouring of 'which the language j
is notably fond, cp. Ovid, Fast. 5, 5783 Met. 6, 425; and often.
