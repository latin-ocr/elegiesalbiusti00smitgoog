morally or ceremonially, 2, ¹, 9-14 and notes.

82. deripuisse: the regular word for the removal of offerings from a tem·
ple, and the opposite of suspendere, fe. ex·votos then as now were regularly
hung up.

The lover steals garlanda which have been offered at a shrine in order to
give them to his mistress. This habit, fostered by motivea os poverty or of
economy as the case may be, is best illustrated by 2, 4, 21-26.

83-84. Both acts are frequently mentioned, eg. Propertius, 3, 8, 11, ‘quae
mulier rabida iactat convicia lingua Ι etVeneris magnae volvitur ante pedes ’;
Statius, Silv. 5, 1, 162, ‘nunc anxius omnibus aris Ι illacrimat, signatque
fores, et pectore terget Ι limina’; Arnob. 1, 49, ‘cum per omnia¹ supplices

1, 28; 1,10,38; 2, 5, 54; 2, 6,4. The dative, however, is the most per·
sonal of all the cases, and lends itself with peculiar readiness to the needs of
a figurative style. The large extension, therefore, especially imthe various
types under the general category of the dative of personal interest (ag. the
dative with transitive and intransitive verbs, the dative of agent, the ethical‘
dative, the dative of reference, the dative of advantage and disadvantage,
the dativus energicus) is characteristic of the Augustas poets, and especially
- of Tibullus. ln fact one of the most striking peculiarities of Tibullus's style
is his extensive and picturasque use of the dative. Here for instance the
dative all but personifies for the moment the grim structures before which the
suppliant is grovelling.

So too of his large use of the dativus energicus instead of a genitive or a
possessive pronoen, ep. es· 1, 2, 96; 1. 1‚64; 1, 3, 313 1‚4‚4; 1, 8, 473

85-86. These lines remind us of the mediaeval penance; in the poet's
time they suggested the worship of Isis, cp. 1, 3, 23-24 and notes3 Seneca,
Dial. 7, 26, 8, ‘cum sistrum aliquis concutiens ex imperio mentitur . . . cum
aliquis genibus per dam repens ululat,’ etc.; Juv. 6, 524 (of -a superstitious
woman), ‘inde superbi Ι totum regis agrum nuda ac tremibunda cruentis Ι
