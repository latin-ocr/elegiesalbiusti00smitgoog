TIBVLLVS

riage she probably never wrote another line. But, like Catullus
and a few ol the chosen‚ this slip of ,a girl has that rarest of
all gifts‚ the gift of straightforward simplicity; and, unhke her
namesake in the next century, as well as some of her poetical
sisters in centuries nearer our own, she shows no trace of sell-
consciousness and no sign of affectation. Moreover her per-
sonality is marked, and she writes from a'full heart. The con-
sequence is that in a scant forty lines she has contrived to
impress herself upon us more deeply than many other writers
have done who have spent a lifetime pursuing the same object
&by more sophisticated methods.

'But, apart from their intrinsic interest and value, these pieces
claim attention as practically all we have left of the poetry
written by Roman women during the classical period. As such
they are regularly used to illustrate the theme of ‘Feminine
Latinity' so often discussed since Gruppe’s time. Ι a'rn in-
clined to think that this theme has been overworked, and
that between our enthusiasm of discovery and the limita-
tions of our knowledge we have emphasized some phenomena
which are not conclusive. It is notan easy matter even in
one's own tongue to acquire the feeling for those often deli-
cate and subtle distinctions of usage uponwhieh an intelligent
and fruitful discussion of this question is so largely based.

Cicero for example (De Orat. 3, 45) makes Crassus say
that the speech of Laelia reminded him of Plautus and Naevius
(see also Pliny, Epist. r, 16, 6),'and it is still true to-day that
the language of women is more conservative than that of their
masculine contemporaries in the same class. ‘Facilius enlm,¹
to quote Cicero's own words, ‘mulieres incorruptam antiqui·
tatem conservant, quod multorum sermonis expertes, ea tenent
semper quae prima didicemnt.’ The elegies of Sulpicia how-
ever aflord nothing distinctively antique, and even if we found
anythilng of this sort, should we be able to justify our classifi·
cation of it as Feminine Latinity?
