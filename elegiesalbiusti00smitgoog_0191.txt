ι, ι, 5] TIBVLLVS

colour (as in the prose oi the Silver Age) it' not a distinctive meaning. More
unusual cases are sepulcra, 1, 3, 83 triumphos, 1, 7, 5; rura, 1, 5, 213 2', 3,
13 solo, 1, 5, 3; sedes, 2, 4, 53; rivos, ι, ι, 28; regna, 1, 9, 86. Otherwise
the examples usually may be explained according to the general rules, eg.
pluralizing oi abstracts oiten makes thern concrete, the plural is indefinite or
typical, distributive, indicates a series, action interrupted and resumed, parts
oi the whole, species ol the getius, analogy, etc. Moreover these divisione
are by ιιο means exclusive, ancl as in English the specihc meaning of the plural
is not always clearly impressed on the mind oi the user. Here the plural
somnos appears to be distributive, ‘one’s sleep o’ nights,’ cp. ‘lt seems his
sleeps were hinder'd by thy railings' (Sbak.). In 1, 48 it is ‘slumbera’ the
sleeper wakes ironr time to time but ‘drops oll' again, at once roused and
lulledbythestorm. Sumusta,1,1,1o; 1, 5, 24, is the‘must’year by year,
but oousto, 2, 3, 66, is typical; cp. vina, 1, ι, 24; 2, ι, 29, andfructus, 1, 1,41:
aquas, 1, 1, 47 and osten, is ‘waters’z ortus, 1, 1, 27; 2, 5, 59, like soles, 1, 4,
2, etc, is day by day, o'.e. distributive: rivos, r, 1, 28, emphasizes the pa'rts
instead oi the whole: nives, ι, 2, 5ο, ι, 4, 2, is show-flakes or snowstorrns,
etc. Οιι the subject in general see Paul Mass, Archiv fi Lat. Leeikographr'e, 12, l
p. 490 ll.-classica: Servius on Verg. A. 7, 637, says ‘classicum dicimus
et tubam ipsam et sonum! pulsa shows that here classica = tubae-pulsa:
lit. ‘amitten’ applies oi course only to stringed instrumenta, cymbala and the
like, as 2, 5, 3 ; 1, 3, 243 Ovid, Met. 10, 205,‘lyra pulsa manu! The transfer
to wind instrumenta is occasional in Greek, eg. Aristoph. Aves, 682 (cp.
Blaydes ad loa), Simonides, 29, Crus. (cp. Smyth’s note), and is attested by
Plutarch (Quaeso. Conviv. 2, 4), but in the Latin authors I find no good
parallel. Huschke cites Claudian, Panegyr. Theod. 313 curtvbva flatu lcui Ξ

plectro pulsanda chelys, but this may be explained by zeugma The regular ¹

military phrase' rs classicum canere..

5 mamea: groupung oi pronouns at the beginning oi the sentence' rs ire
quent in the poets. So 1, 1, 49; 1, 2, 433 53; ⁶5³ 715 89, etc, esp.
Ovid. Here the emphatic position oi me marks its antithesis to alius in 1. ς
-ραιιροιῐιιιιι as Seneca, Epist. 87, 40 careiully defines.it, is not poverty, Ξ

egestas, but parvi possessio. So Martial says (ιι, 32, 8), ‘non est paupertas, ¹

Nestor, habere nihil) The estimate ol what constitutes paupertas, a slender
income, is largely influenced by the personal equation, cp. lines 77-78 and
introd. p. 32. For the line, cp. Culex, 97, ‘securam placido traducit pectore
vitam.’-traducat: should be given its strict etymological meaning. So
διάγειν in Sophokles, Elektra, 782, χρόνοι διῆγέ ,taur ὡς damonem: cp.
Demosth. ι8, 89; Xen. Rep. [oe. 1, 3. The metaphor oi lile as the path oi
¹one’s march to the grave is still further emphasized by the case oi vito, ablat. Ξ
