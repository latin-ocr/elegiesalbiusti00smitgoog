⁶9· et passim semper amarunt: enlarged upon in 71-76. For the theme
see 1, 3, 63-6411. The Epicureans us'e it to illustrate their theory of the
utterly savage condition of primitive man, cp. Lucret. 5, 962, ‘et Venus in
silvis iungebat corpora amantum Ι conciliabat enim vel mutua quamque
cupido Ι vel violenta viri vis atque impensa libido Ι vel pretium, glandes

atque arbuta vel pira lecta' ; Hor. Sat. 1, 3, 109, ‘quos venerem incertam
‚ rapientis more ferarum Ι viribus editior caedebat ut in grege taurus’; A. P.
396, ⁴ suit haec sapientia quondam Ι publica privatis secernere, sacra profanis

Ι concubitu prohibere vago, dare iura maritis,’ etc.
Tibullus grants the primitive condition but makes it idyllic; cp. thesaure

theme and point oi 'view in Propertius, 3, 13, 25 —

From the idyllic to the comic is but a step, and doubtless in this case the
step was actually taken in the Old comedy. For us, however, the motive so
treated seems to be confined to the more modern authors. The old Trouvere,
ior instance, tells usthat in that wondrous Laud os Cokaigne (Way's trans.) -

Striie, and ire, and war were not;
For all was held by common lot3
And every lass that sported there
Still was kind and still was fair;
Free to each as each desir'd,

And quitted when the year expir'd3
For, once the circling seasons past, ·

Surest vows no more might last.

So, too, Lovelace exclaims-

Thrice happy was that golden age,
When compliment was constru'd tage,
