'lhe use of this dare (from dha) decreases in poetry in the order, epic, drama,
elegy. ln elegy the largestuse is found in ovid, the least in Tibullus. In prose
mostly in those who favour the poets‚ like Livy, or in those who favour the
popular speech, like Celsus. For afull discussion of this subject see Thiel·
mann’s Das Verbum Dare.

17-ao. The statement that time accomplishes all things (a favourite theme,
cp. eg. Ovid, T rist. 4, 6, ι-ι4; Plato, Ante. Pal. 9, 513 etc.) is illustrated by
two standard exx. arranged in two pairs, emphasized and distinguished not
only by the disticm themselves but by anaphora of longa dies in the one as
opposed to anaphora of annus in the other. Further the first pair show that
patience and persistence can surmount all odds: they therefore apply es·
pecially to the first half of 15-16. Again, the second pair show in addition
that progressis made even though we may fail to observe it from day to day:
they therefore apply especially to the second half of 15-16. See n. on 11-14.

17. Tasso, Aminta, 1, 2, 'La lunga etate insegna all¹uom di porre Ι Freno
ai leoni,’ seems to have had this line in mind.

The subjection of the beasts is an old locus communis of the poets taken up
as usual and cherished by the philosophers and rhetoricians as an illustration
of three favourite discussions-first, as a symptom of the deterioration of life
since the Golden Age, cp. 1, 3, 41 n.; second, as an example of the tireless
energy and the wonderful inventive genius of man, cp. eg. Soph. Antig. 333,
Aisch. Prom. 460, eto, third, to exemplify as here, the power ·of time and
perseverance, cp. Ovid, Ars Amat. 1,471; Trist. 4, 6, 1-8, etc. The standard
exx. in all three are the horse and the ox. Tib. selects the lion to enforce
his point partly because the ex. of the ox was already suggested in 16, more
especially however because the lion is the fiercest and most intractable of
beasts, the greatest possible contrast to his tamer in physical strength and
power. Ovid’s metbod of developing the same idea in the same connection
is an excellent ex. of rhetorical amplification and, incidentally, of Quintilian’s
remark that Ovid was ‘nimium amator ingenii sui,' cp. T rist. 4, 6, 5, and line
19 n. below. The essential homeliness of Tibullus’s illustration is shown by
the popular use of it in other times and nationalities, cp. as an ex. of the sec·
ond discussion above, Uncle Remus’s story of ‘ Mr. Lion.’

18. ‘Constant dropping wears away the stone’ is a proverb in Latin and
Greek as well as in English. The oldest form and the one most quoted is the
verse of Choirilos of Sarnos, πέτρην κοιλαίνει ῥανὶς llberos ἐνδελεχείῃ, cp. also
Bion 2 (ιι); Plutarch, Mor. 2 D ; Lucret. 4, 1286, r, 3ι 3 ; Propert. 2, 25, 16;
