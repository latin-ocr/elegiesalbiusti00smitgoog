TIBVLLVS

Messalla. Here however Ι cannot choose 3 ior love is stronger
than ambition‚ and Ι am in love. (Note the compliment to
both Messalla and the girl, and how artiully we have been led
by a series oi hints to this point.)

Now as isin reply to the implied reproach oi the previous
lines he names the girl, and immediately adds-‘But lame
and fortune are nothing to me, Delia, ii you will only love me
as long as Ι live. Death would be sweet alter such a lile.
Death however cuts off love, and old age makes it ridiculous.
Both come anon. Let us therefore make the most oi youth
while it is yet ours. Here 1 arn in my clement. Here in
iact Ι have already taken service. Hence therefore‚’ etc„ and
he ends on the lreynote (1-6).

By way oi comparisou‚ let us examine the first elegy ol
Propertius to Cynthia (ι, 1). ·

1-8. Since I iell in love with Cynthia Ι have b'een utterly
helpless in her hands. She has ruined me, and I have no
redress.

9-18. The myth oi Milanion and Atalanta the huntress, tie. y

. (following the Alexandrian mle, see p. 15) the literary proto·
type of his own case. The transition from 8 to 9 has been
postponed to 16-18, so that he can ,sum up aiter his lavourite
iashion, and proceed to his next topic by showing that the
prototype is not as complete as it appeared at first sight.
‘Preces' and ‘benefacta’ saved the day ior Milanion, but his
wits were sharpened by adversity, mine, alasl are paralyzed.
19·30· Ii these iakirs from Thessaly with their stale moon

trick could make her sufferas Ι suffer‚I might believe anything
oi them.

Help, friends! But κιο, it is too late.

Take me to the ends oi the earth beyond the reach oi woman-
kind. Only the happy should stay here. My case is desperate.

35 ff. Beware‚ ye lovers all, and shun the fault Ι iell in.

There is no careiully managed transition here as in Tibullus,
