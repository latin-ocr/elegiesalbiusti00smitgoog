2, 5, ⁶3] TIBVLLVS·

The Sibyl’s statement implies that this use ol laurel leaves was ior some rea·
son considered perilons. Il, however, as generally agreed, the laurel ol an· ἵ
tiquity, Apollo’s laurel, is to be identified with the bay oi sweet laurel (Laurus
nobilis,Linn.),neither this idea nor the belief in their efficacy lor inspiration ¹

can be derived lrom any real, inherent qualities ol the plant itsels. The
leaves when crushed are aromatic and slightly bitter, but perlectly harmless.
Modern physicians describe them as ‘stimulant and narcotic,' and among
primitive taces any 'stimulant or narcotic is associated with the divine fremy,
but the bay possesses these qualities to so slight a degree that they do not
suggest a solution os the problem. Moreover, as Ogle notes (A. J. P. 31, 302),
Pliny even when he writes ol plants used to produce visions (24, 160) malles

no reference to any intoxicating property οἰ laurel nor do any ol the writers l
on medicine. More likely, and perhaps more in keeping with a primitive .
point of vieW, is the suggestion (Rohde) that the spirit of Apollo was supposed ,

to reside in bis tree and that the priestess became inspired with it in this way.

Aristotle attributes the gift of prophecy or oi prophetie inspiration to a l
large amount ol ‘blaclt bile' near the hrain, cp. Problem. 30, 1, πολλοὶ δὲ καὶ 4

διά τὸ ἐγγὺς εἶναι τοῦ mpori τάπου τὴν θερμότητα ταύτην νοσήμασιν ἁλίσκονται
μανικοῖς, ἡὲνθουσιοστικοῖς, ὅθεν Σίβυλλαι καὶ Βάκιδες καὶ ol ἔνθεοι ’γίνονται πάν·
τες, ὅταν μὴ νοσήματι γένωνται, ἀλλά φυσικῇ κράσει.
