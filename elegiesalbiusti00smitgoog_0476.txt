Noras [2, 5, 85

here a further allusion to Actium. ‘To the Roman, esp. at this time, Egypt
was a land of monstrosities? Cp. Propert. 4, 63 Hor. od. 1, 37, 9—21;
Juv. 153 esp. the Graeco-Roman proverb, cp. Pliny, 8, 42 (of Africa), ‘ideo
multiformes ibi animalium partus . . . unde etiam vulgare Graeciae dictum,
“semper aliquid novi Africam afferre ''’ (del φέρει τι Λιβύη καινὸν κακόν,
Zenob. 2, 51).

81-82. The extent to which laurel crackles when it burns is proverbial, cp.
μείζονα βοᾷ δάφνης χλωρᾶς καιομένης (Diogen. 6, 52; Suidas,s.v.); Lucret.
6, 154, ‘nec res ulla magis quam Phoebi Delphica laurus} terribili sonitu
flamma crepitante crematur'3 ovid, Fasti, 1, 343; Pliny, 15,135; etc. The
method of divination by means of it to which Tibullus refers was regularly
practised, not only in sacrifices, but 111 magic. Cp. Ovid, Fasti, 1, 3443 4,
742; etc. 111 magic esp. 111 the moon charm, cp.Theokrit. 2, 24; Verg. E.
8, 823 Propert. 2, 28, 36; Nemes. 4, 65; Geopon. 11, 2, 4, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν ταῖς
μαντείαις rotoma αὐτὴν παράστασιν προφητείας δοκοῦσιν εὑρηκέναι. Ogle
suggests (A. J. P. 31, 296) that ‘as the craclrling is simply an indication that
the fire had caught, perhaps the omen in the first place depended upon
whether the fire burned or went out. This is to be inferred from Theokrit.
2, 23 f.: the good ornen consists 111 the fact that the laurel was entirely
consumed and left 110 ashes; in the same charrn as given by Vergil, E. 8,
rob-7 the flame alter dying down, suddenly brightens again. We see from
Propert. 2, 28, 35-6 that the reverse was a bad omen! It is probable,
too, that we may trace here the influence ,01 the same idea as that referred to
111 63 nabore. ,

This passage of Tib. is referred to by Rabelais, 3, 18 (after the visit to the
Sibyl of Panzoust)‚ ‘Vous (dist Epistemon) ne responden a ce que le rameau
de laurier. . .brusloit sans bruyt ne grislement aulcun. Vous scavez que c’est
triste augure et signe grandement redoubtable, comme attestent Properce,
Tibulle, Porphyre philosophe argut‚ Eustathius sus l’iliade Homericque, et
,aultrea Vrayment (respondit Panurge) vous me alleguez de gentilz veaulx.
112 feurant 1012 commes poetes, et resueurs comme philosophas : autaut pleins
de fine follie, comme estoit leur philosophie?

82. omine 1 for the ablat. cp. 2, 6, 36.

841. 1t is noted that the poet touches upon the three motives of prosper·
ity (increase of crops, floclrs, and the family) regularly referred to by the
Greek authors, ag. Hesiod, W. and D. 232 ; Herod. 3, 653 Alsch. Eumen.
9073 Soph. 0. T. ¹723 Aristoph. Pax, 1320, etc.

85-86. 1, 1, 10 11; 1, 5,23-24n.; 1, 7, 35-36; 2, 1, 45-46. Cato, 113,
says, ‘de lacu quam primum 1110111111 dolia indito. post dies XL diffundito
inamphoras.’
