2, 4, 53] Trnvmvs

5'3-54. Cp. Ovid, Rem. Amor. 299, ‘saepe refer tecum sceleratae facta
puellae, Ι et pone ante oculos omnia damna tuos. Ι “illud et illudhabet necea
contenta rapina est: Ι sub titulum nostros misit avara Lares, Ι . . .” haec tibi
per totos inacescant omnia sensus: Ι haec refer, hinc odii semina quaere tui’

53. On selling the Lares cp. eg. Propert. 4, 7, '475 Juv. 11, 17. A semi·
proverbial synonym os the last extremity of want or extravagance. The Eng-
lish parallel (aa in the case ol Charles Suriace) would be the family portraits.
-sssedesr the plural, os one place, is found in prose as well asin poetry.

54. suh imperium, etc: zie. at auction. imperium, r'.c. magisteria}
authority, a custom dating from the time when the auctio was specifically the
public sale ol booty taken inwar. Hence the expression sub kasta or sub
corona venire for auctio.

55-60. The poet is even willing to drink down every known love charm,
i.e. resign the last chance ol escape from his thraldom, ‘si modo‚' etc. There
wasa large trade in love charms, pocula amatoria, and they actually were
osten administered (1, 8, 17-18 n). The specialist in this line was the lena
(1, 2, 42 n). People in the condition described by our poet as his own were

osten thought, and doubtless with reason, to be the victims ol them, cp. 1, Ἴ

2, 594211, Propert. 4, 7, 72, ‘sed tibi nunc mandata damus, si forte mo
veris, Ι si te non totum Chloridos herba tenet,’ etc.

55-56. An echo of these lines is pointed out by Traube in Kyd’s Spanish
Tragedy, 2, 5 end (Hieronimo’s last speech in' this act, which he gives in
Latin). Lines 5-6 are ‘ipse bibam quicquid meditatur saga veneni, Ι quic-
quid et herbarum vi caeca nenia nectit.'

Circe and Medea are named together as here by Propert. 2,1, 53, ‘seu
mihi Circaeo pereundum est gramine, sive Ι Colchis Iolciacis urat aena focis ’;
Ovid, Ars Amat. 2, 103; Claud. In Rufi 1, 153, etc. Circe (cp. Hom. Ooyvss. ,
ιο, 2103 Apoll. Rhod. 3, 3113 4, 487-689; Ovid, Ars Amat. 2, ¹03³ Hor.
Epoat17, 173 Val. Flacc. 6, 4453 Claud. ln Rufi 1, 154, etc.) and Medea
(1, 2, 51 n.) are the two great enchantresses of antiquity and the stock ex·
amples os the type. — quidquid: for quidquid with the genitive see 1, 1, 5111.

55. habet Circe, etc: the present tense suggests that the poet was think-
ing os those books current in his own time purporting to contain all the
charms ol these great specialists, cp. 1, 2, 51 n.-veneni: used here in the
old sense (cp. herbarum, 563 herbas, 60; 1, 2, 51 n.) oi potion, philtre‚
cbarm, cp. a similar development of meaning in φάρμακον. The distinction
between a drug, a poison, and a magle philtre tends to disappear as we ap·
proach the primitive stage of popular belief.

56. Thessala terra: for Thessaly, the land of marvels, see 1, 2, 51 n.;
Propert. 1, 5, 6; Lucan, 6, 4383 Pliny, 30, 6 and osten.
