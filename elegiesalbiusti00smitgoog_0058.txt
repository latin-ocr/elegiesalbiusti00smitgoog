INTRODUCPION

appointment of Messdinus, Messalla's eldest son, as one of the
XVviri sacris faciundis. The date cannot be fixed exactly, but the

fact thatin a list of the XVviri belonging to the year 18 ne.
the name of Messalinus comes last suggests that at that time the
appointment was still recent. If so the piece was composed not
long before the poet’s death in 19.

The sixth elegy is addressed to the poet Macer on the eve of his ·
departure fora distant campaign. 'Assuming as probably we may,
that this is the Aemilius Macer who died in Asia in 16 ac, it
seems likely that the last poem of this book is also the last work of
its author. This and the fact that the book itself is smaller than
the average libellus favour the assumption of its posthumous publi-
cation. The theory however is of course incapable of proof, and
has been strenuously opposed.

At any rate the poet's love affair with Nemesis, of which we
hear in the last four elegies (2, 3-6), must have ended not long
before his death. We hear of the usual lena in the usual way.
The girl also has a rich lover of the usual sort. F inally- and this
seems to be abit of genuine history-we hear of her little sister
who early in the affair with Tibullus fell from an upper window,
and was killed. Otherwise Tibullus’s story of his last love is
largely a Jeremiad occasioned by his own ,woes
. The name of Nemesis, though occasional in actual life, was un-
doubtedly a pseudonym. As Marx has pointed out, Nemesis, like
Elpis, Eros, Pothos, etc, comes from the domain of Greek erotic
poetry. It typifies the idea of retaliation, ol repayment in kind
for injuries received, of which we hear so much in the Anthology
(5, ²73 : 9, 260, 405 : 11, 326: 12, 141), and which Tibullus
himself expresses in 1, 9, 79. Marx· also observes that Nemesis
often appears in representations of Eros and Psyche (Baumeister,
3, 1425), and that when our poet writes (2, 6, 27)-

Spes facilem Nemesim spondet mihi sed negat illa,
he seems to be thinking of the opposition between Νέμεσις and
Ἐλπίς which we still find in Anile. 9, 146, and in works of art.
