ferat'; Terence, Eun. 853, ‘unam hanc noxiam Ι amitte: si aliam admisero
umquam occidito'; Pharna 141, ‘nunc amitte quaeso hunc: ceterum Ι posthae
si quicquam, nil precor’; Petron. 49, ‘deprecari tamen omnes coeperunt et
dicere : “solet fieri: rogamus mittas: postea si fecerit, nemo nostrum pro illo
rogabit.’'' ‘This time don’t count,' as Rip Van Winkle says.

7-10. The plea is really the solet fieri ol Petronius just quoted, ae. ‘All
menate greedy of gain, therefore Marathus deserves mercy! The poet pre·
fers to suggest it per exempla instead of stating it in so many words. The
prototype of Tibullus here is such passages as Solon, srag. 12, 41 Cras. -

el δέ τις ἀχρήμων, πενίης δέ μιν ἔργα βιᾶται,
κτήσεσθαι πάντας χρήματα πολλὰ δοκεῖ.

σπεύδει δ’ δλλοθεν ἄλλος· δ μὲν κατὰ πόντον ἀλᾶται
έν νηυσὶν χρῄζων οἶκαδε κέρδοι δγειν

ἰχθυόεντ’, ἀνέμοισι φορεύμενος ἀργαλέοισιν,
φειδωλὴν ψυχῆς οὐδεμίαν θέμενοι·

δλλος γῆν τέμνων πολυδένδρεον εἰς ένιαυτδν
λατρεύει, τοῖοιν καμπύλ’ δροτρα μέλει· etc.

Α few of the standard parsuits of mankind are constantly used hythe poets,
rhetoricians, and philosophers for purposes of illustration. The most com·
mon are the farmer, merchant, soldier, and iuris consultus, cp. eg. the famous
dramatic passage of Hor. Sat. ι, ι, 4- 22, in which all four play their traditional
parts. Pairing ol the farmer with the soldier as contrasts or as bere with the
trader is frequent and always for the purpose of emphasizing some marked
contrast between the simple life (idealized or not according to the author’s mood

and apart from the usual ambitions of the world at large) as opposed to the pur-
suit of fame and fortune by the soldier, or simply of a large bank account by

the trader, in both cases at the peril of life and limb. The contrast is nearly
always to the advantage of the simple life, cp. the vignette of 1, ιο, 39-44;
ι, 2, 65-75, and esp. 1, 1, and ι, ιο, both elaborations of the theme that the
idyllic peace and happiness of the simple country life are better than the sol·
dier¹s feverish career of toil and danger. A favourite contrast between the
larmer and the trader (cp. also 1, 3, 39·4o n.) is illustrated by Hor. Od. ι, ι,
ιι (cp. Sat. I.c.), ‘gaudentem patrios findere sarculo Ι agros Attalicis condi-
cionibus Ι nunquam demoveas, ut trabe Cypria Ι Myrtoum pavidus nauta secet
mare. Ι luctantem Icariislluctibus Africum Ι mercator metuens otium et oppidi Ι
laudat rura sui: mox reficit rates Ι quassas, indocilis pauperiem pati! Another
point often made is illustrated by Propertius, 3, 7, 43, ‘quotl si contentus patrio
bove verteret agros, Ι verbaque duxisset pondus habere mea, Ι viveret ante snos
dulcis conviva penates, Ι pauper, at in terra nil ubi flare potest.’
