original and genuine lolk conception ol Elysium as specifically the home ol
the gods is still clearly prominent in Homer. Mortals gain it not by merit
but through birth or family connection. Menelaos eg. is promised Elysium,
οὕνεκ’ ἕχεις Ἑλένην καί σφιν γαμβρός Διός ἐσσι. Otherwise, the last abode os
mortals, good or bad, is the House of Hades, ἔνθα re νεκροὶ ἀφραδέες ναίουσι
βροτῶν attona καμόντων. Beginning with the early Orphics we see the grad·
ual growtb of the great idea ol recompensa beyond the grave. Hence Elysium

became more and more the reward ol mortal virtue—or orthodoxy-Tar· ¹
taros a specitic place of punishment for the mortal wrongdoer. This theory
, os recompensa begins as early as Pind. Olymp. 2, 653 frag. 132 Chr.; and

succeeding philosophers and poets derelop the traditioual topography os
Hades, locate the place os punishment there, and specily more or less clearly
the· details ol torture. With this passage ol Tib. cp. esp. Ovid, Ibis, 1733
Met. 4, 449. Other important passages are Aristoph. Rau. ¹453 Plato,
Phaedo, 1085 Gorgias, 5263 Rep. 10, 6163 [Arriaca] 371 E; Lulrian,
Nekyomant. 143 Vera Hirr. 2, 29; Iuppit. Consul. 173 Verg. A. 6, 548;
Seneca, Herc. Fur. 664; Lucret. 3, 978·1023. In Homer (ll. 8, 14, cp. 481)
Tartaros is only the prison house ol the Titana-terrifically deep, darlr, and
strong. The same is true ol Hesiod ( Theog. 713) who however adds further
details.

tanturn tenditque sub¹ umbras, Ι quantus ad aetherium caeli suspectus
Olympum’; Hom. Il. 8, 133 Hesiod, Theog. 720.

In antiquity and at all periods the darkness ol Tartaros is one ol the ¹
specific terrors of the world to come, cp. Lucret. 3, 1011, ‘Cerberus et Furiae ¹

iam vero et lucis egestas’3 Seneca, Epist. 24, 183 Dial.6,19,4; etc, esp.
Erinna, frag. 3 Crua, τοντόθεν sle Ἀίόαν κενεὰ διανήχεται ἀχώ· Ι crat δ’ ἐν
νεκύεσσι, τό δὲ σκότος όσσε καταγρεῖ. ’

67. scelerata seties: perhaps a more or less established name in Latin sor
the Greek Tartaroscp.Verg. A. 6, 563; Ovid, Met. 4, 4563 Cic. Cluent.
1713 Ovid, Ibis, 1743 etc. scelerata of course :sceleratorum -in nocte
profundat ep. intenebris, 1, ιο, ςο. 111 both exx. the preposition emphasizes
the conception as one os place, not time, cp. 1, 1, 61 n. ·

68. flumina: Homer mentions no rivers in connection with Tartaros. The
idea is suggested in Hesiod, Theog. 736. Plutarch, Mor. 1130 C, quotes
Pindar's (frag. 130 Schr.) ἔνθεν τόνόπειραν ἐρεύγονσαι σκότον Ι βληχροὶ trom-
ρᾶς νυκτός ποταμοί. But see esp. Plato, Phaedra, 113. Verg. A. 6, 551 -uot
yet written at the time Tib. composed this passage —and Seneca, Phaed. 1227
spealr only of Phlegethon. Ace. to Plato, l.c., flumina here wouldxCocytus -
and Pyriphlegethon, both of which surround Tartaros, though runnlng in
