1, 7, 13] TIBVLLVS

a short distance from the mouth ol the Cydnus, and we may be sure that
Cleopatra’s famous barge, which ‘like a burnished throne, Burned on the
water‚’ never passed up through Tarsus and by Antony on a rapid river (Shak.
Antony aad Cleopatra, 2, 2, 191 f.; Plutarch, Ancon. 26, etc).

13. Cydne: sor the description generally as well as for the epithet caeruleus
see Curtius, 3, 4, 8, ‘Cydnus non spatio aquarum, sed liquore memorabilis, quippe
, leni tractu e fontibus labens puro solo excipitur nec torrentes incurrunt qui
placide manantis alveum turbent. itaque incorruptus idemque frigidissimus,
quippe multa riparum amoenitate inumbratus, ubique fontibus suis similis in
mare evadit'; Appian, Anah. 2, 4, 7; Dio Chrys. Orat. 33, 2; Lulrian, Dom.
13 etc. The practical Xenophon (Anah. 1. 2, 23) says that the river was 200
feet wide at Tarsus-tacitis: lor the epithet in this connection cp. Hor.
Od 1, 31, 83 Sil. Ital. 4, 35o; etc.

14. caenuleus: both caeruleus and caerulus occur as early as Plautus and
Ennius and continue throughout the language. Older writers and their irni-
tators generally prefer the shorter form, but the limitations of dactylic verse
necessitate the use of caeruleus sor the oblique cases or wherever the final
syllable is long. Later grammarians undertoolr to distinguish in meaning,
but the choice as here is merely a matter ol convenience. The same is true
of many other adjectives existing in both a longer and a shorter form.—
vada: ie. ‘the bed ol the river,’ so 2, 5, 343 Ovid, Met. 1, 3703 Fast. 1, 5013
Seneca, Herc. Fur. 680; etc. For the plural see 1, 2, 503 1, 5, 3 and note.

15-16. Bulgar Dagh, the part of the Taurus range to which the poet refers,
is about 11,οοο feet in height. Strabo says, however ( 520), that it was capable
of cultivation to the summit, which, even if not literally true,is enough to
justisy Tibullus’s use of alat here.

15. The only instance of hyperbole quoted lrom Tibullus.

16. alet: ior alere thus used of mountains cp. Livy, 5, 40, 53 Anti. Pal. 5,
19, 5.-Cilicas: so always, see 1, 2, 52 n. ’

17-18. The white doves of Syria, which were sacred (hence intacta) to
Astarte, are olien mentioned hythe classical authors, eg. Catull. 29, 8 ; Ovid,
Met. 2, 5363 4, 443 Mart. 8, 28, 13; esp. Diod. 2, 4, 6, and Lulrian, De Dea
Syr. 14 and 54. Doves were also sacred to her Greek parallel Aphrodite,
cp. Alexis, 214 K, etc.

The heaping ol adjectives here (intacta . . . alba . . . sancta) which
Latin habitually avoids is only apparent. intacta goes with volitet and sancta
stands sor a clause with Palaestino Syro.

17. ut volitet: sor indirect questionswith ut: ‘how,' cp. 19 ; 1, 8, 57 and
583 2, 1,15; 2, 1, 25 (see note); 2, 5, 72. Note the artistic variety of indirect
questions in this passage (13-24), ‘quantus . . . ut . . . ut . . . qualis . . .
