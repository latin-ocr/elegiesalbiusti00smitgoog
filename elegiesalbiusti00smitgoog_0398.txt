‘Let 111 be silent! We purify our fields 'and crops 11111 the ancient tradi-
tional rite. 001111011,Β1111101,1111110110101111. On this holy day let
all work 11111 and let every one don 'festal garb and do honour to the god.

‘See, the sacred lamb is approaching the altar, and behind it wallis the
throng clad in white and crowned with olive.

‘Gods of our fathers, we purify field and follr; do ye banish all mischief from
our bounds, and grant that our grain be abundant, that 011 sheep be safe from
the wolves. Then shall all be hopeful, happy, and prosperous.

‘My prayers are answered„ See the favouring signs in the victim’s liver.

‘Now bring the old Falernian. 'T is 1 holiday, therefore drinlr deep and
never flinch‚ drink till all goes round. ’

‘let every man join in a health to our absent Messalla, the conqueror of
Aquitaine, the glory of his ancient house. Do thou be with us in spirit and
inspire my song of thanksgiving to the rustic divinities. They lifted us from
savagery 111 taught us agriculture 111 the arts, the orchard, the guden, the
vineyard. In the country are the cornfields and the bees; in the country the
Lares received 1111111111101111113.Ι Aye, it was none other than the farmer in
his respite from toil that to do honour to his gods upon their holy days in-
vented song and music, also the donce from whence our drama sprang. Here
too grew the fleece, and here was discovered by woman her specific rask 01

‘Even Cupid himself, they say, was 1 country lad 111111 11 the fields 111
arnid the floclrs. There he made his first attempta at archery. Ah me, his
aim is unerring now, nor does he practise on the flocks alone as of old. He
loves to transfix the girls, he delights in humbling the proud spirit of men.
Happy 111 those upon whom he loolrs with favour. Holy one, come now
and partalre of our cheer. But, prithee, leave thy arrows and thy torches
behind thee. lnvoke him, all of you—openly for the iloclrs, secretly for
yourselves. Nay, spealr out even for yourselves. In all this noise no one will
hearyou.

ι1111 joy abound! Night yolres her steedsanon‚ and the golden Stars dance
merrily along behind their mother’s chariot. And aiter them comes Sleep
poised amid his tawny pinions and sable Drearns scarce conscious of their
steps! '

1. quisquis 11111, faveat: the poet who as head of his house acts as
chief priest begins the ceremonial with the regular‘favete linguis, favete voci·
bus,’ which was always addressed to those present, the obiect being to prevent
even the chance utterance of some word of ill omen upon such an important
occasion, cp. eg. Servius on Verg. A. 5, 71, ‘in sacris taciturnitas neccssaria
