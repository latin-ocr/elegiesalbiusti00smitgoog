‘what tirne I might: r'.e. ‘il meanwhile l might! The temporal particles
cum, quando, and (the locutive) ubi are used to indicate conditional relations
in which the idea of time or space is involved (Gilu-Lodge, 590, ιι. 3), cp. 1,
5, 9 n. No other cases ol this use occur in Tibullus.

⁶. valido pingue: a strong hoe for a fertile soil (which was esteemed the
best soil lor vines, cp. Verg. G. 2, 184, etc).

7. modu: ‘in the manner os.’-cu1vum= aie. because the plough stoclr
(buris) iscurved (Verg. G. 1, 170).

especially strong physique, partly, no doubt, because great bodily strength or
rude healtb ls suggestive os those who have to work lor a living and are there·
sore no better than slaves, cp. Ovid, Trist. 1, ς, 72, ‘invalidae vires ingenuae·
que mihi'; Martial, 3, 46, 6, ‘invalidum est nobis ingenuumque latus’; ιο,
47. ⁶. etc· ,

So too sunburn and blistered hands are mentioned here not only because
they suggest pain and discomfort as well as great bodily fatigue, and imply
work which no man ol the poet's position would think os doing, but also
because the lover's appearance is injured by them. The elegiae lover should
be pale (ι, 8, 52 n), and his hands should be delicate, cp. ag. Ovid, Amor.

Apollo and Admetos began with Rhianos (Schol. on EuripAlkest. t) and
henceforth became one os the most common illustrations, as here, os the
power ol love, cp. Kallimach. Hymn. 2, 49 ; Ovid, Her. 5, 1513 Met. 2, 680;
etc. The Church Fathers osten use it in their attacks on the old gods, cp.
Minue. Fel 23, 53 Augustin. C. D. 18, 13 ; Lactant. ι,,ιο, 3, etc.

’Πιε older version was that Apollo was ordered by Zeus to serve Admetus
one year (Eurip. Alkest. 8) as a punishment for having slain the Kyklopes
(Hesiod,Val. llaec. 1, 444), the sons ol the Kyklopes (Pherelrydes), or the
Python (Alexandrides of Delphi). Many echoes ol Tibullus's version are
found in Carducci‚ juvenilia, 27 (‘A Febo Apolline'). For a fine modern
variation os the theme see George Meredith's poem, Phoebus wirla Admetus.

ιι. Nemes. 2, 72, ‘di pecorum pavere greges, formosus Apollo, Ι Pan
doctus, Fauni vates et pulcher Adonis,’ iscited as a reminiscence os this line.

nor, when he saw that to win was impossible, did (13) his knowledge ol
physic h'elp blm to cure himself.
