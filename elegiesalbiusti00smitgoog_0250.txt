Tibullus’s description is brief and simple aster his usual manner and as he-
fits ita purely episodic character. The particular emphasis on idyllic simplicity
and peace belongs to the tradition of his department. . It is also in harmony
with his temperament besides being the artistic justification of the digression ’
at this point. The motives which he selects are all traditional, and as usual no

with the Golden Age persisted until a iate date, not only in the genuine follr

Polit. 276 A), Saturno rege, as here, Saturnia regna (Verg. E. 4, 6), cp. aureus
Saturnus (Verg. G. 2, 538), etc.
