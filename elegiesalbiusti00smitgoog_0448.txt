It is first mentioned by Aristotle, De Animal. Hisr 6, 18, 4, who discusses at
some length the two or three charms known by this name, op. also Verg. G.

Amor. 1, 8, 8; Med. Fac. 38; Propert. 4,5, 18. The idea 01 its efficacy is
derived from the same principle as that which, egr, prompted the horrible scene

This is the longest 01 Tibullus's poems, and the only one 01 a national
character. The immediate occasion 01 it was the fact that Messalinus (line
115), the eldest son of Messalla, had been made one 01 the X Vvt'ri sacris
faciundis. The date cannot be fixed exactly, but the sact that in a list
01 the X Vvirr' belonging to the year 17 rac. (Ephemeris Eng. 8, 233) the
name 01 Messalinus comes last suggests that at that time his appointment was
still recent, and, therefore, that this poem was written not long before the
poet’s death in 19 nc.
