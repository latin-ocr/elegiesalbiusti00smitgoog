p. 93. This elegy has been much discussed. See the literature cited by
Schanz (cp. p. 30, n. above). Since then (1911) Jacoby's theorias have
called out two important articles: J. J. Hartmann, ‘De Tibullo Poeta,’
Mnemosyne, 39 (1911), pp. 369-411; R. Reitzenstein, Hermes, 47 (1912),
80-116. Pohlenz (‘ Χάριτες, Friedrich Leo,’ etc. Berlin, 1911, p. 104)

our e egy-

and a cheertut horne, the simple toil and the simple saith 01 the country-side.
My ancestral wealth is no more, but t am at peace, 1 observe the proper rites,
