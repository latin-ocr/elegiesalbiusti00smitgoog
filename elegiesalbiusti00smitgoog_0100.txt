INTRODUCTION

none of his anticipatory hints, no recurring notes with added
motives and variations. Propertius does not pause sor transitions,
he does not anticipate, osten the general statement is only to be
derived fronr a series of particulars, he does not end as Tibullus
does. ‘My case is pitiable - worse than its prototype — my case
is hopeless. Lovers, take warniug ere you regret it.' Such is the
sum oi his thought. In other words Propertius is highly emo-

man whose ieelings are already too much sor him. Much oi the
difficulty and not a little os the modernity os this great poet may
be traced to these emotional qualities of his style.

Still a different type is represented by Ovid. lt varies accord·

with a statement oi his theme- ’

As regards the once popular theory of strophic arrangement we
are probably saie in saying that so iar as not only Tibullus but also
the entire elegy is concemed such regular recurrence as we ob·
serve is due simply to rhetoric. On general principles strophic
arrangement should not inhere in any types of poetry except those
with which the accompaniment oi music or the dance is tradi-

tional and constant. The recurring strain os music, the recurring '
,, figure oi the dance, the opposition oi chorus to chorus, of sex to

sex, os shepherd to shepherd, is the real and reasonable basis of
strophic arrangement and demonstrates its value and usefulness.
‘lbere is nothing now to show that it was characteristic even oi
the earliest elegy which was accompanied by the flute. The
