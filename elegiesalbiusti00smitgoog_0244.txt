reasons why some of thc more superstitious Romans were led to consider it a
dies nefastus, a day upon which it was unlucky to begin any important under-
taking, cp. Horace, Sat. 1,9‚ ⁶93 Ovid, Rem. Amor. 2203 Ars Amal. 1, 415;
Meleager, Anah. Pal. 5, 160 (written iu the first century rac), Pers. 5, 184;
Juv. 14, 1053 etc. Opposition, however, to sabbatarianism was steady and con·
sistent until the very fall of the Western Empire, cp. Tacitus and Juvenal,
l.c.; Rutil. Namat. 1, 3813 etc. The genuine Roman objected to itas a for-
eign superstition, still more because it introduced so many days of idleness.

Tibullus was undoubtedly acquainted with our modern week of seven days,
each named for and under the sway of one of the seven planeta. An inscrip-
tion found at Pompeii iu 1901 (CIL. IV, 6779) has SATVRNI SOLIS
LUNAll MARTls÷IOVISV11N11R18, rie. ‘Saturday, Sunday,¹ Monday,
Tuesday, (Wedncsday is illegible), Thursday, Friday.’ The presence init of
QVI, i.e. Quintilis, the old name for July, suggests a date before or not long
after 44 B.C. At any rate this is the oldest contemporary reference to the
matter as yet discovered on ltalian soil. 'The origin and growth of our mod·
ern week has been much discussed (the best and most recent authority is E.
Maass, Tagesg'o'tter, Berlin, 190²)· Cassius Dio, 37, 18 (and many modern
authorities follow him), says that our week originated in Egypt. The state-
ment is supported by the fact that the seven planets themselves are so inti-
mately associated with astrology and that the beginnings of astrology, sofar
as we can now trace them, take us back to Egypt of the Ptolemies. Maass,
however, makesa strong plea for a somewhat different theory of origin. His
conclusions brielly stated are:

‘The seven-day week without the planets is Jewish.’

‘The seven planets as gods 'governing the destinies of mankind are
Assyrian)

‘The combination of these two ideas, rie. the formation of our modern
week, is due to the Hellenistic Orient, starting from Ionian Asia Minor!

‘It is impossible as yet to name a date)

‘The week of seven days is thus really a product of cosmopolitan Hellenism
which, starting in the Greek East, spread over the entire Roman Empire and
was finally adopted by the Christians.’

The earliest references to it ou Italian ground are all confined to southern

Italy, cp. CIL. l.c.; 12, p. 218 (found at Posillipo, now at the Johns Hopkins ,

Univ., early Empire, see H. ln Wilson, Α. ]; P. 31, 261), etc. A similar
seven-day calendar belonging to Trimalchio is described by Petron. 30.
Official recognition (statues of the seven gods, etc. in Rome) begins as early,
perhaps, as Trajan. Soou after it appears in Gaul, and Cassius Dio, l.c., wirit-
ing in the time of Septimius Severus, says that the practice of naming the
