INTRODUCTION

the poet intends to convey. Hence the lines that immediately

follow-—

inter spem curamque, timores inter et iras
omnem crede diern tibi diluxisse supremumr
, grata superveniet quae nou sperabitur horu, '

the plain implication ol which is to the effect that in spite ol every
reason to the contrary our poet is too inclined to despondency,
that he is upset by trilles-the besetting sin of a high-strong, las-
tidious soul-that he worries too much over his health‚ and that
he is unreasonably haunted by the sear of death. Ι ’
In other words, though strange to say Kiessling seems to have
been the dirst to observe it, Tibullus wa's a hypochondriac.
Horace had already seen more than enough of it in his friend
Maecenas. In the case ol Tibullus it would be easily superin-
duced by his probably delicate childhood. Il so, a mild formos
it may well have been fostered in later years by the anxious
ministrations of his devoted wornen folk at honre. .
The discovery ol this peculiarity is more or less illuminating.
For example we know that the tendency to melancholy, the
tendency to dwell upon death, to luxuriare in the details ol one's
prospective funeral, even the inability to struggle with a degrading
passion, are all elegiae commonplaces. But we also know that
they are in harmony with the poet’s supposed condition. Here
then we are even less certain than before. On the other hand we

have good reason now to suspect that his illness at Corcyra was by . ·

no means so serious as he thought it was. Even the word reptare v
which Horace uses to describe his iriend’s habitual gait suggests a
man who is convinced that he must not overtax his strength.
Finally it is more than probable that Tibullus’s tendency to
look upon the darker side hada direct influenceon his pointel
view regarding his own work. For example he would naturally
find, as Horace seems to have done, that the fussy, assertive
Propertius was not to his taste. Even his literary methods and his
artistic point of view were utterly at variance with those oi Ti-
