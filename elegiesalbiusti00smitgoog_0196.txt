NOTES [r. ι, 29

hall-shut eyes, beneath the floating shade Ι Os willows grey, close-crowding on
the brook,’ Gray's Elegy, 101 f. (cp. Lucret. 2, 29) and osten.

Tbe intense and supposedly balelul heat ol the dog-days and the idea still
entertained that the dog-star has an influence upon it are referred to again
and again, eg. Homer, Il. 22, 26-31; Verg. A. ιο, 273; G. 2, 353; 4, 4253
Archil. 58, Crus.; Hor. Od. 3, 13, 93 ι, 17, 17; Tib. 1, 4, 6 and 423 1, 7, 21 ;
3, 5, 2 (Lygd.); Ovid, Ars Amat. 2, 231, etc. Ι

27. ortus: see note on somnos, 4. The plural begins with Homer, cp.
Odyss. 12, 4, ἀντολαὶ Ἠελίοιο. The plural, as already explained, is distribu-
tive. Note too that, given the primitive habit of applying the singular to one
concrete instance, we must use the plural is we wish to generalize.

28. rivos: see4 n. A running stream gives the impression ol a plurality
ot' streams. So rivi iu Juv. 6, 4303 Hor. Od. 3, 13, 7, cp. loquaces lymphae,
15 ; rivi sauguinis, Verg. A. ιι, 6684 9, 4563 Schulze cites Homer, Il. 16,
229, ὕδατος ῥοαί, Odyss. 6, 216, ῥοαὶ ποταμοῖο. 86 we say regularly ⁴ floods’
ol rain, ‘streams’ ot blood, ‘banks,' ‘shores’ ‘sea‘s,' ‘woods,’ ‘waters’ etc.

29-32. Note tenuisse and increpuisse beside referre instead ot' rettulisse.
With impersonal verbs as here the present infin. is normal throughout the
language. Replacement of it by the perfect infin· is a notable characteristic
ol the Augustan poets (all learned in Greek) and especially os the elegy.
The Latin analogy was the old legal use with velle, cp. below, but the influ-
ence ot' the Greek aorist can hardly be doubted, cp. eg. Hor. A.P. 98, ‘si
curat cor spectantis tetigisse querella) In lact the Latin 'perfect really had
absorbed the form and the fonctions ol the aorist. These forms occur most
frequently in the second hals os the pentameter where their metrical conven-
ience is obvious; but in many cases the distinction is quite clear, and in dealing
with the remainder it is unsafe to urge mere metrical convenience as the sole
excuse, even when as here (cp. also 45 below, etc.), both pers. and pres. occur
side by side in the same sentence.

In Tib. the exis. ol the perf. infin. as a subject are-with pudet, 1, 1, 293
ι, ιο, 17; ι, 2. 94; 1. 9, 293 iuvat. 1. ι, 46 and 743 4. 7, 9; decer. 1. 2. 28³
paenitet, ι, 4, 47; puger„ 1, 6, 523 4, 4, 43 prodest, 1, 8, 9 and 70; inuret, 1, 8,
25; 2, 3, 703 gloria est, 1, 6, 4; laus tribuetur, 4, 4, 2'03 sitsama, 4, 7, ις
sit satis, 1, ιο, 623 sit, ι, 6, 24; 4, 3, 3 (where see note).

The peri. intio. act. as an object is lound more or less at all periods aster
velle, which seems to have been a legal usage, so ι, 4, 56, ι, 6, 64; 2, 5, 102
(where see note) ; 4, 6,6 and 18. Otherwise mainly in the poete, queat, 1,
9, 643 4, 5, 16; audeat, 2, 1, 9 (see note); gestit, 2, 1, 713 optarim, ι, 6, 74,
where, however, the distinction between perf. and pres. is clear.

The perf. infin. with verbs ot' saying and thinking ollers nothing unusual.
