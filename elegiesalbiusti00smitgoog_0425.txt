2, 3, 29] TIBVLLVS

29-30. The clause with cum (really ‘oiim curn non pudebat’) is incor-
porated with the verb of saying‚ cp. 2, 5, 19 ιι. on postquam ,· 2, 3, 17, ‘quo-
tiens dicitur erubuisse ’ ; r, 5, 9n.

31-32. fabula ι ‘a scandat: ‘a byword‚’ ‘the talk of the town.’ So often,
cp. r, 4, 83 ; Ovid, Amor. 3, 1, 21, etc.; cp. Propert. 3, 25, ι-2.

32. leo compares tbe Pompeian graffito (Carm. Epr'g. 937 B.) ‘scribenti
mi dictat Amor mostratque Cupido τ Ι a peream, sine te si deus esse velim) —
stt mavult ε 1, 2, 25a n.-·d0us ε for the emphatic position cp. 2ο ιι. above.

33. at tu: the dives amator of 59f. tu is tbe subject of some verb in
tbe missing portion of the incomplete sentence. The general drift of itis
suggested by such parallel addresses to tbe victorious rival as 1, 5, 69370-in
this case, however, modified by the fact that in order to be consistent with
bis preceding argument that foveis invincible tbe poet must acknowledge -
and ‘cui tristi fronte Cupido imperat? etc. indicates that he did -tbat his
rival is no more to blame than was Apollo, therefore that the real fault is tbe
greed of Nemesis. So different from the Golden Age, a brief reference to

which must have occurred at tbe close of the lacuna, cp. ⁶ ferrea saecula' below ,

and n. -ls ε tbe subject of es. es instead of est, because isis the representative
of tu. A shift to the third person in cases like tbisis attributed by Schmalz
(par. 27) to the influence of Greek.

34· nostra domo: 1, 1, 61 n.

35. fenea saecula ι the Iron Age, the unbappy present, as opposed to the ,

Golden Age, the happy past, cp. 33 ιι. above. For the theme see ι, 3,
35-50 and notes. The final conclusion was that the one great cause of the
fall of man has been bis greed. So Tibullus bas worked it out here, and his
cboice of praeda to represent tbe idea was peculiarly apt. The main motive
of warfare is greed-gratified by praeda, ‘rapine'-cp. 1, 1, 1 and
notes. The stock example of the praedator (41) is the conventional rival of
the elegiae poet, the dives amator (1, 5, 47-48 n.). the ricb parvenu whose
wealtb is acquired by means more or less accurately described by the word
praedator. Thus while addressing himself to Nemesis (47-48 f.) the poet
manages at the same time to score his rival. The contrast between Venerem
and praeda sounds lilre a far-off echo of the theory of Empedokies that
Aphrodite not Kronos was the ruler of the Golden Age.

36. operataz Tibullus's use of operari is confined to the second boolr.
The best general translation of the word seems to be something like ‘to be
concerned with,’ Thus 2, ι, 9 ‘to be concerned with the god,’ ie. to do him
honour (so 2, 5, 95); 2, ι, 65 ‘to be concerned with busy Minerva,’ i.e. ‘de-
voted to,‘ ‘engaged in’ ; here, ‘concerned with,’ r'.e. ‘involved with,' ‘carry
with itself,’ whence the later meaning of ‘ oause,’ ‘effect’ etc, is easily derived,
