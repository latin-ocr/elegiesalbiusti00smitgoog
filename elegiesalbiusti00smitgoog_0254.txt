fact that mordere really does describe the action of the horse iu both cases.
In the passage before us domito precludes any possibility of misunderstanding.

Iovem nulli subigebant arva coloni: Ι ne signare quidem aut partiri limite
campum Ι fas erat: in medium quaerebant,' etc„ and the discussion in
Seneca, Epist. 90, 36 ff. Any serious treatment of the Golden Age ledinevi·

The same theme was developed at some length by Ephorus in his account of
the idealized natious of the North (Miiller's FHG. vol. Ι, p. 256). Many

others emphasize the same point. Tibullus, as often, leaves it to be inferred

' from the context, cp. 1, 9, 7-10 and notes.

43. non domus ulla fores habuit: no oue was shut out-not even lovers,
cp. 2, 3, 73. Of course, too, there were no thieves-this nalve touch
reappears in Juvenal, 6, 18, ‘cum furem nemo timeret Ι caulibus et po-
mis, et aperto viveret horto! Others insist that there were not even any
houses in that perfect age of nature when spring was eternal, eg. Ovid, Met.
1, 121 (of the Silver Age), ‘tum primum subiere domus: domus antra fuerunt}
et densi frutices et vinctae cortice virgae ’ς Seneca, Phaed. 539, ‘silva nativas
opes Ι et opaca dederant antra nativas domus ’3 Epist. 90, 41, ‘illi quos aliquod
nemus densum a sole protexerat, qui adversus saevitiam hiemis aut imbris
vili receptaculo tuti sub fronde vivebant, placidas transigebant sine suspirio
noctes. sollicitudo nos in nostra purpura versat et acerrimis excitat stimulis:

who like the Epicureans did not believe in an ideal state of nature or a fall
from grace made much of this point as an illustration of the hard and
wretched lot of early men, cp. Lucret. 5, 9703 9823 Juv. 6, 2, etc—non

44. regeret: regere (for dirigere) fines isa legal phrase found in Cicero,
the Digest, and elsewhere. The use of the simple verb for the compound is
antique aud therefore more or less characteristic of the conservative language
of religion aud the law ; so too the literal meaning of the word is often best
