PREFACE

Turs edition contains the first detailed commentary in
English upon the entire textos Tibullus, Sulpicia, and the
anonymous elegies of the fourth book. Whether the
edition has any further justification of its existence must
be lelt to the judgment of the reader.

The text coincides in the main with that of Hiller’s
recension (1885, reprinted 1899). Changes are recorded
in the Appendix‚ and details of textual transmissi0n‚ when-
ever they seem to be of sufficient importance‚ are discussed
in the Notes‚ The Panegyricus Messallae and the elegics
ol Lygdamus are not dealt with in the Notes‚ and, owing
to the uncertainty ol their pedigree‚ the two Priapea some-
times found in editions of Tibullus are not included in
the text. It is obvious, however, that intelligent and
profitable study of our poet must be accompanied by ire·
quent recourse to the entire Carpus Τ ibullianum as it now
stands. No portion therefore of the traditional text has
been omitted. The “Testimonia Veterum,” by which the
text is followed, contain whatever else antiquity has to say
of Tibullus’s life and work.

In its present form the Introduction is the result ol a
thorough revision in the interests of brevity and simplicity.
Not a little hasbeen completely excised‚ discussion ol the-

ories‚ and especially ol untenable theories‚ has been reduced .

as a· rule to a passing reference, and a considerable body
ol material in the chapter on the poet's art hasbeen trans·
