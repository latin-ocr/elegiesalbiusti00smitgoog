1, 4, 15] T1BVLLVS

English word in this connection, as eg. in Scott's ‘'Ihough mautled in her
cheek the blood.’ Again if we take stare as merely giving the picture (1, 1,
64 n.) and ns emphasizing the idea of permanence (so often sedere with ante),
as eg. Seneca, Herc. Oet. 936, ‘stabo ante ripas immemor, Lethe, tuas Ι et
umbra tristis coniugem excipiam meam ') then stat ante here might=‘bide
upon) In that cnse the phrase would bea close parallel, as it ought to be,
of adest above and it would also be a variation of sedere and the like, which is
’ not uncommon in this connection, cp. Juv. 4, 74, ‘in quorum facie miserae
magnaeque sedebat Ι pallor amicitiae’; Ovid, Met. 2, 7755 Trist. 3, 9,
18; esp. Pindos, Nem. 8, 1, Ὦρα πότνια, κᾶρυξ ’Δφροδίτας Ι ἀμβροσιᾶν
φιλοτάτων, Ι άτε παρθενηίοις παίδων τέφίζοιαα γλεφάροις· Mosch. 1, 3, imm
. . . βλεφάροισιν ἐφάμαν Soph. Antig. 782, Ἐρως . . . ds ἐν μαλακαῖς παρειαῖς Ι
νεάνιδος ἐννυχεύεις (imitated by Hor. Od. 4, 13, 8). Note that the μαλακαῖς
παρειαῖς of Soph. = the teneras genas of Tibullus.

15-16. For this rule ep. Ovid, Ars Amat. r, 4703 Propert. 2, 25, 15; Nemes.
4. 5⁶·

15. negabit: so regularly to a lover, cp. 2, 6, 27; Propert. 1, 6, 9; Ovid,
Amor. 1, 8, 73, etc.

16. dabit: Owing to the absence of aspirates in early Latin dare from the
root da, ‘to give' (Gk. δίδωμι), and dare, ‘to put,’ ‘set up,' ‘place' from the
root dha, ‘to put,’ ‘set up,' ‘place' (Gk. τίθημι), became indistinguishable in
form and coalesced. Hence the dare of historical times is really a ‘ mixed’
verb in the same sense that the ablative is a‘mixed’ case and the‘ perfect
indicative a ‘ mixed’ tense. The prevailing member of the combination was
always dare, ‘to give) Occasionally however and esp. in the conservative lan·
guage of law, religion, and poetry, hence also in the popular speech, the
sleeping partner emerges and asserts its rights just as the instrumental does in
the ablative and the aorist in the perfect indic. Here for instance (and as a
rule with the construction dare aliquem or aliquid with a preposition orhdverb)
dare means ‘to put' or ‘place’ cp. Ovid, Ars Amat. 1, 162, ‘snb tenerum
scamna dedisse pedem’; Sil. Ital. 4, 511, ‘Massylum . . . alis castra sub ipsa
datis'3 Tac. Ann. 13, 39; more often with in, Ovid, Met. 11, 784, ‘se dedit
in pontum’; 15, 66, ‘in medium discenda dabat’; frequently with super in
the medical writers, Celsus, 5, 28, 13, ‘super plagam medicamenta danda sunt ';
with retro, Ovid, Met. 1, 5293 3, 88, etc. No other good ex. of dare from dha
‘to place ’ or ⁸ put' construed as here occurs in Tib. (2, 4, 44 may be explained
otherwise and cases like 1, 2, ¹43 1, 8, 70; 1, 10, 223 2, 3, 403 2, 4,48,in
which the dative may or may not represent an original cons. of the accus.
with in need not be considered here).

For other constructions in Tibullus in which dare from dha survives or isto
