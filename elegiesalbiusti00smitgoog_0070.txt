romances oi Honore u’Urfe, which at that time were especially
popular.

One oi the most notable literary developments of the nine-
teenth century was the rise os the German elegy under Goethe and
his contemporaries. The great leader himself was most deeply
affected¹ by Propertius, but a number of translations, among
others that ol Johann Heinrich Voss (1810), and no less than
four annotated editions, are in themselves ample proof that the
interest of the German public in Tibullus at this time was un-
usually deep and widespread.l ,

In France and Italy too the literary tradition of Tibullus was
continued, but on the whole, and especially in England during the
Victorian period, the interest in him during the nineteenth century
was less general than in the previous age.⁹ Tennyson shows
no traces os him. On the other hand Cranstoun’s translation, ²
published in 1872, is the best complete version in English, ¹and
the occasional renderings of Elton (1814) are still admired.
Whiflen’s versions (1829) are deservedly lorgotten. The best
F rench translation is by Mantinon ( 1895). Williams’s translation
(Boston, 1905), so far as I know, is the first version by an Ameri-
can. Among modern writers who show traces of his influence =
the most notable is Carducci.³

IV. CRITICISM AND DISCUSSION

It will be seen that t'he inlluence os Tibullus upon subsequent
thought has on the whole been considerable. And yet it has
probably been less than that os any other great Roman poet.
Literary echoes oi him are rare, quotations srorn him are uncommon,

lThe influence oi Tibullus on German literature is now being studied by Dr.
R. B. Roulston‚ Associate in German in the Johns Hoplrins Universlty, and his
results will soon be published.

2A few occur in Byron and Moore. The Lake Poets and their kind appear
to lrnow nothing ol the elegy.

⁸See esp. his Juvenilz'a, 27 and 31.
