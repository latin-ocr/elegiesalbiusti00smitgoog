This lot be mine. Let him be rich-he deserves it-who can face the Ἴ

frowning skies and the madness of the seas. Perish rather all the wealth of
Ind tban that any girl should weep because 1 had taken to a soldier's life·
For you, Messalla, it is meet to wage war by land and sea and to hang your
house with trophies. 1 am chained at home a helpless thrall of love. But I
care not, dear Delia, for the praise of men. So long as l am with you they
are welcome to say 1 am without energy and without ambition. May we he
together till death comes to part us, and may you follow my body with many

tears to the grave. Until then let uslove while we may. Deatb comes anon, 2
anonpalsiedeld. Now is the time for lightsome love and for all the mad ’

pranks of thoughtless youth. In these wars 1 am good either to lead or to
follow. Be ofl then, ye alarums of war, bring wonnds to greed, aye bring
riches too. With my little store l do not dread want and I do not desire
wealth.’

1-52. The quiet life and idyllic simplicity. The favourite motive of
Tibullus (cp. esp. 1, 10), and constantly recurring in antique literature, esp.
during and after the Alexandrian Age. See note on the Golden Age, 1, 3,
35-483 Hor. Eporle, 2; Vergf G. 2, 493 fl.; Columella, Praefat. 7 ; Seneca,
Poetae Lat. Minores, IV, p. 74 B.; Mart. 10, 47 ; Propert.¹ 1, 63 3, 3, 41.

1-2. For the wish cp. 1, 10, 29 ft, for the conventional division of wealth,
2, 2, 13-16; Hor. Sat. 1, 2, 13, ‘dives agris, dives positis in faenore nummis,¹
etc. The lines are imitated by Ovid, Amor. 3, 15, 123 Fart. 3, 1923 Porri.
4, 9, 863 Mart. r, 85, 2; 116, 2, 6, , 16, ι2; perhaps Claud. In Rufi 2, 134.

1. fulvo: poetic; cp. the ‘red gold’ of our older literature, eg. ‘Of
red golde shone their weedes,' or, ‘ here’s a red rogue to buy thee handker-
obers! The prose word is flarius, Mart. 12, 65, 6, ‘an de moneta Caesaris
decern flavos,’ ‘ten yellow boys,’ etc. - auro: ablat. instr, cp. opibus, 1, 7, 59.
So the ablat. is instr. with vivere in 25; decidere, 1, 2, 3o; perrepere and
tundere, 1, 2, 85-86; fieri, 4, 6, 14 and note; traducere, 1, 5 below and note;
aperta, 1, 6, t8; ridere, 1, 9, 543 crepitare, 2, 5, 81 ; exstruere,2, 5,99;
vetare, 2, 6, 36, etc.

a. culti . . . soli: hence of course ruore valnable. There is no reference
here to the confiscations (Introd. p. 32). Indeed, Ullrnan, ‘Horace and
Tibullus,’ A.J.P. 33, 160, shows that the losses to which the poet indirectly
refers were probably due to something more serious and personal than con·
fiscations. He suggests, in short, that the Albius whom llorace mentions as
having a mania for the collection of bronzes (Sat. 1, 4, 28) -

hunc capit argenti splendor: stupet Albius aere, Ι

was the father of Tibullus. If so, the shrinlrage in the family fortune is
