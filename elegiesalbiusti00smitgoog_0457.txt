was composing his Aeneid, cp. eg. Α. 1, 276, where Jupiter says, ‘Romulus
excipiet gentem et Mavortia condet Ι 11102212 Romanosque suo de nomine
dicet. Ι his ego nec metas rerum nec tempora pono: Ι imperium sine fine
dedi,’ etc. See also Livy, 4, 4, 4; 6, 23, 7; 28, 28, 11; Tiberius (in Tse.
Ann. 3, 6), ‘principes mortales rem publicam aeternam'; Sulpicia, Sat. 335
Sil. Ital. 7, 4763 esp. the fine passage in Rutil. Namat. ltin. 47-140. The
emperor Hadrian built a temple to Venus and Rome and dedicated it on
April 21, the birthday of the city. At that time aeterna became 211 official
title of Rome, and we begin to find ‘ Urbs Roma Aeterna’ or ‘Roma Aeterna’
on coins-formaverat: sle. ‘shaped,' ‘traced,' cp. ag. Verg. A. 9, 8ο, ‘tcm-
pore quo primum Phrygia formabat in Ida Ι Aeneas classem! See also 2, 3,
’ 6911. on amarunt. '

24. Alluding, of course, to the old legend that Remus was slain by his
brother for leaping over the wall of the new town. The story was told by
Ennius, cp. Ann. 99 V (Romulus to Remus), ‘nec pol homo quisquam faciet
inpune animatus Ι hoc nisi tu: nam mi calido das sanguine poenas.¹ See also
Cicero, Off. 3, 41 ; Hor. Epod. 7, 17; Propert. 3, 9, 5ος livy, 1, 73 ovid,
Fasti, 4, 837; 3,69 (sostened); etc-consorti: may be used in the sense of
brother (Ovid, Met. 11, 3473 13, 663; Pont. 3, 2, 483 etc.) as wellas of co·
heir (Minue. Felix, 31, 8, etc). Remus was both (Verg. A. 1, 2924 Propert.
4, 1, 93 etc). Strictly speaking, habitanda should go with urbis. Agreement,
however, with moenia is natural enough, and in this case is dictated by metri·
cal convenience.

25-26. A favourite detail in these descriptions, cp. Propertius, 4, 1, 1, 'hoc .

quodcumque vides, hospes, qua maxima Roma est, Ι ante Phrygem Aenean
collis et herba fuit; Ι atque nbi navali stant sacra Palatia Phoebo, Ι Evandri
profugae concubuere boves. Ι fictilibus crevere deis haec aurea templs, Ι 1122
fuit opprobrio facta sine arte casa,' etc.; 3, 9, 49-504 Ovid, Ars Amat. 3, 119,
‘quae nunc sub Phoebo ducibusque Palatia fulgent, Ι quid nisi araturis pascua
bubus erant?'; Fasti, 1, 243, ‘hic ubi nunc Roma est ¹incaedua silva vire-
bat, Ι tantaque res paucis pascus bubus erat '; 1, 199 f.; 5, 91, etc.

25. pascebant: takes here its more usual cons. as in Verg. G. 3, 143; 4,
181, etc. See 2, 3, 42 n. Note the succession of picturesque imperfecte in
this passage (25-34).— Palatia: 1, 1, 4 11. The plural is due to the exigencies
of metre. The singular is possible only when the final syllable can be elided
before a short vowel (in this period generally undesirable). Even in the
plural the genitive, dative, and ablative (Palatiorum, Palatiis) are quite im-
possible. So of Capitolia and of all other nouns of the first and second de·
clensions in which the final syllable is preceded by a trochee.
