TIBVLLVS

Alexandrian development was away from the lyric toward the
narrative type. After and even before that time a musical ac-
companiment was not characteristic of the elegy. The Romans,
as we have seen, did not sing their poetry, but declaimed it.¹
Tibullus's peculiar method of developing his theme which has
been described above is one of the most notable marks of that
kinship with Mimnermos long ago observed by Gruppe and since

, then commented upon by Sellar‚ plessis, leo, Crusius, and others.

Itis also interesting to observe that this scheme of exposition is
in entire harmony with the traditional wave effect, the to and fro
of thought and emotion, produced by the distich itself.

Here too Tibullus was an artist of the first rank and went his ⁸

own way. For mastery of the distich we may pair Tibullus with
Ovid, Propertius with Catullus and probably with Gallus, whom
Quintilian describes as ‘durior’

The general laws of the distich may be learned from any gram·
mar andare the same for both languages. As soon however as
we investigate details and variations of usage, we find that the
Roman distich as finally developed by the great masters is dis-
tinctly national In tracing its growth on Roman soil and in de-
fining Tibullus’s position in the process two laws of general appli-
cation should be kept iu mind.

The first is that in every department of Roman poetry the
progress was always toward greater strictness of technique. Ex?
ceptional usage, whether inherited from the Greek norm or per-
mitted by Latin itself, has a tendency either to disappear or to be
confined by certain definite restrictions. Hence the most strik-
ing difference between Catullus the beginner, still too near his
Greeks, aud Ovid the master, who had before him not only
Gallus, Propertius, and Tibullus, but many other poets since lost.

salty accepted; cp. Leo, Gru. Gel.Am.1898, p. 56: 'lt is impossible to derive
a literary form from a musical form: the elegy has no more connection with the
nomos than the sonnet with the sonata.’
