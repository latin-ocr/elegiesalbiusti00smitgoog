NOTES

In deseris solitude.

Ι should have then this only iear,
Lest men, when they my pleasures see,
Should hither throng to live like me,

And so make a city here.

William Walsh says in the Preiace to his Poems,¹1am satisfied that Catullus,
Tibullus, Propertius, and Ovid were in love with their mistresses when they
upbraid them, quarrel with them, threaten them, and iorswear them: but 1
cannot believe Petrarch in love with his. . . . 1 am pleased with Tibullus
when be says he c'ould live in a desert with his mistress where never any hu-
man footsteps appeared, because 1 doubt not but lte really thinks what be says!

9-10. secretis: ‘solitary,' ‘remote,'is not iound elsewhere iu the Tibul·
lian corpus, aud humanus is contined to Lygd. 3, 4, 26.

rr-ra. Parallels of these striking lines are numerous, eg. Meleager, Anrh. ,
Pal. 12, 60, ἦν &vider Θήρωνα τὰ πάνθ’ ὁρῶ· ἣν δὲτὰ πάντα Ι βλέψω, τόνδε
δὲ μή, τᾶμπαλιν οὐδὲν ὁρῶ· Propert. t, 13, 36, ‘et quodcumque voles, una sit
ista tibi'; Mart. 12, 21, 10, (Romam tu mihi sola iacis,’ etc. Propertius, 1,
11, 23, ‘tu mihi sola domus tu, Cynthia, sola parentes, Ι omnia tu nostrae tem-
pora laetitiae,’ isan echo oi Homer,.ll. 6, 429, cp. Ovid, Her. 3, 51.

Professor Postgate compares Hood’s ‘The sun may set: hut constant love
Will sbine when he’s away, Ι So that dull night is never night, Ι And day is
brighter day! Suffollr in Henry VI (Second Part, 3, 2, v. 360) says to the
Queen-

A wildemess is populous enough,

So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:
For where thou art, there is the world itseli,
With every several pleasure in the world,
And where thou art not, desolation.

11. nocte vel atra lumen: Professor Postgate finds the turn oi‘nocte vel
atra’ prosaic and quotes Propertius, 4, r, 143, ‘ illius arbitrio noctem lucemque
videbis’ a ‘similar thought (rie. to “lumen noete vel atra '’) poetically ex-
pressed.' The connection, however, shows that Propertius here has simply
iurbished up a particularly homely and forcible proverbial phrase ior being
completely under one's thumb, cp. note on tenebris, 1, 2, 25, and eg. Petron.
37 (the freedman describing Fortunata's hold on Trimalchio), ‘ad summam,
mero meridie si dixerit illi tenebras esse, credet!

12. 80118 locis: this ‘Propertian turn oi language',’ as Professor Postgate
terms it, occurs in all styles and at all periotlS, cp. Plautus, Rud. 2055 Lucret.
6, 396 ; Cicero, Diu. 1, 59; Quintil. 5, 13,28; Ovid,ller.11,84,etc. The
line is repeated in alate inscription, CIL, 10, 378.
