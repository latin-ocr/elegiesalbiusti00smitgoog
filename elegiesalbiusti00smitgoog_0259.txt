57. facilis: when used with the dat. (rare) as here = ‘open to,' ‘snscep-
tible to.’ The virtue is that of 1, 2, 97.

58. ipsa Venus: i.e. instead of Hermeswhoisthe usual ψυχοπομπός. The
reason for the special favour is given. Moreover he is not destined to endure
the common lot. In an epitaph of the Flavian period apparently influenced
by this passage we have (Carm. Epig. B. 1109, 19), ‘non 'ego Tartareas
penetrabo tristis ad undas, Ι non Acheronteis transvehat umbra vadis, Ι non
ego caeruleam remo pulsabo carinam Ι nec te terribilem fronte timebo Charon,
Ι nec Minos mihi iura dabit grandaevus et atris Ι non errabo locis nec cohi·
bebor aquis. . . . nam me sancta Venus sedes non nosse silentum Ι iussit et
in caeli lueida templa tulit,’ cp. 2, 3, 3-4; 2, 6, 1-2. —in Elysios: so Stat.
Silo. 5, 1, 1933 Angustia. C. D. 10, 30, otherwise ad. Without a prep. Verg.
A. 6, 54²·

59-64. Contrast the long home of the common man as described in 1, 10,
35-38. This is not a specific Lover’s Elysium but a description of the life and
surronndings of lovers in Elysium, and the same is true of the beautiful parallel
passage in Propertius, 4, 7, 55 (cp. Culex, 261) which should be compared
with this. Ace. to Verg. A. 6, 441 which goes bacls through some Alexan·

drlan source to Hom. Odyss. 11, 225 (cp. 321 fand the famous picture of Polyg· ¹

notos described by Pausanias, 10, 28, 29) those who die for love occupy the
Lugentes Campi, cp. Ausonius’s poem, 'Cupido Cruciatus,’ Idyll 6. Tibullus,

like Propertius, l.c., assigna the faithful but unfortunate lovers to Elysium itself. χ
The detail is characteristic of Greelr erotic poetry, esp. of the Alex. Age, bnt l ³

have discovered no trace of it there. Among modern echoes cp. Remy Bel-
leau, ‘La Bergerie’ (OEuvres, Lemerre, Paris, vol. 1, p. 311), and esp. Car·
ducci, ‘A Neera’ (juvenilia, 31). Rousard's Chamon, ‘Plus estroit que la
vigne? etc, also has some points in common. The passage is deliberately

imitated by Bertin, Anzours, ι, 13 (cp. 1, 1, 45-46 n.), and possibly by Gentil· ἵ

Bernard, L'Art d’Aimer, zio. 33 but perhaps Vergil, l.c., rather than Tibullus,
prompted Suclrling to exclaim-

Ο for some honest lover¹s ghost,
Some kind unbodied post
Sent frorn the shades belowl

l strangely long to lrnow
Whether the noble chaplets wear
Those that their mistress’ scom did bear
Or those that were used kindly, etc.

59. choreae cantusque: ie. in honour of the gods. This traditional de-
tail was much emphasized by the philosophers, especially the mystics, and
has always occupied an important place in the inherited description of
