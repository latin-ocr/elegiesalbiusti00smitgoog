49-51. One of many references to the primitive belief—as characteristic
of Africa or Australia as it was of Greece and Rome-that wizards can and
do influeuce the weather. The classical prototype is the bag of winds that
Aiolos gave to Odysseus (Odyss. 10, 20) and in the Middle Ages the same
method was still pursued by the witches (esp. of Lapland and Ireland): cp.
Webster‚ ‘henceforward 1 will rather trust Ι The winds which Lapland witches
sell to men'; Nashe, ‘For, as in Ireland and in Denmark both, Ι Witches
for gold will sell a man 1 wind, Ι Which in the corner of a napkin wrapped Ι
Shall blow him safe unto what coast he will’; Shak. Macheth, 1, 33
and often in the Elizabethan writers. References in the Roman poets, esp.
in the conventional list of magic feats, as here, are frequent, eg. Ovid, Amor.
1, 8, 9, ‘cum voluit, toto glomerantur nubila caelo; Ι cum voluit, puro fulget
in orbe dies'3 Met. 7, 2013 4245 14, 3683 Lucan, 6, 461 f. (a good ex. of
his characteristic exaggeration); Val. Flaccus, 8, 351, etc. In mediaeval Latin
such persons were known as tempestarii (see Ducange, av.) and came under
the „ban of the law (so in the Capitulara'a of Charlemagne, 789 A.D., cp.
Codex Theodos. 9, 16, 5; lex Rom. Visr'goth, 6, 2, 3, etc). As early as the
eighth century the matter attracted the attention of the Church (Decret. Syn.
Episc. 799 A.1>.; Burchardus, Decret. 10, 8, etc.) and in the witch trials
which aster the promulgation of Urban’s famous bull of 1484, thanks to the
activity of Sprenger and his successore, went on continuously for a century
and a half, we hear much about this sort of magic.

Diod. Sic. 5, 55.

51. malas herbas: malas here means ‘baleful’ and is not uncommon
in connection with magic, cp. the κακὰ φάρμακα of Odyss. 10, 213 (Circe)
and elsewhere. -Medeam a touch revealing the Medea of popular fancy, not
the Medea of Euripides, Apollonios, Ovid, and Valerius Flaccus, but Medea
παμφάρμακος (Pind. Pytt. 4, 233), the arch enchantress of all antiquity. In
the time of the elegiae poets there were books purporting to contain her charms
and spells, just as in these days dream books and the like are still published
in which Osthanes, Zoroaster, etc, are the chief authorities quoted. Several
of the Greek papyri found in Egypt during the last few years contain material
of this sort; cp, too, Horace, Epod 5, 61, ‘cur dira barbarae minus Ι venena
Medeae valent’; 17, 4, ‘per atque libros carminum valentium Ι refixa caelo
devocare'sidera’ (the moon charm, 43 n., was one of Medea’s specialties);
Ovid, Ars Amat. 2, ror, ‘non facient ut vivat amor Medeides herbae’; Amor.
1, 8, 5, ‘illa (the witch) magas artes Aeaeaque carmina novit,’ etc. Τ111
prominence of Thessalyas a land of magic and magicians was popularly
ascribed (Aristides, 1, p. 76, Dindorf) to the fact that she emptied her box
