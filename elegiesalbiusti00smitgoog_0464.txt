his play the Alimom'um Romuli et Remi. It was told at length by Ennius
in his lineroles. A fine passage from it, the dream oi Ilia, is quoted by Cicero,
Dio. 1, 40 (Ann. 35-51 V.). The detailed narrative oi Ovid,Fasti, 3,9 f. (cp.
Amor. 3, 6, 45) probably goes back to Ennius and should be read in this con·
nection, cp. also Verg. A. 1, 274 3 7, 6593 Hygin. Fab. 2523 Livy, 1, 4, 13
Dionys. Hal. 1, 763 Plutarch, Rom. 3; Konon, 483 FestuS, 267 M.; etc.
The name llia seems to be due to the intrusion oi the Aeneas legend. In
the old Italic version she is known as Rea Silvia. ln the elder version
followed by Naevius and Ennius, Ilia is the daughter oi Aeneas. In Ennius
she has ahalf sister, the daughter of the Trojan wife oi Aeneas’s youth. She
herself,therefore,isthe daughterof Aeneasand Lavinia. Amore careiul study,
however, oi chronology disclosed agap of at least 300 years between the
foundation of Alba and the period oi Romulus and Remus. Ilia was then
made a daughter of Numitor, a scion oi the Silvii, ie. the long line oi shadowy
Alban irings sprung from Aeneas and Lavinia with which the gap had been
filled. Note that Tibullus follows Vergil (A. 1, 274) in passing directly from
the foundation ot Alba to the story of Ilia. This, however, was merely ior
artistic reasons. Vergil names some of the intervening Alban kings in
another place (A. 6, 756). Tibullus's treatment of this story aa a picture of
the future passing before the prophetie vision of the Sibyl is esp. skilful and
artistic. ·

She had gone to the river ior water, as usual, early in the morning (cp.
Ovid below) and having just leit the altar was, as a matter oi course, wearing
her vitta (5 3), ie. a part of her costume as a Vestal. deseruisse implies that
she was never to return. sUpon reaching the river she fell into asort of super-
natural slumber, Qiring which she was approached by the god. So Ovid,
Farti,3,11-·

Silvia Vestalis· quid enirn vetat inde moveri?
sacra lavaturas mane petebat aquas.

ventum erat ad molli declivem tramite ripam:
ponitur e summa fictilis urna ooma:

fessa resedit humo, ventosque accepit aperto
pectore, turbatas restituitque comas.

dnm sedet umbrosae salices volucresque canorae
fecerunt somnos et leve murmur aquae.

blanda quies furtim victis obrepsit ocellis,
et cadit a mento languida facta manus.

Mars videt hanc, visamque cupit, potiturque cupita,
et sua divina furta fefellit ope.

somnus abit, iacet illa gravis, iam scilicet intra
viscera Romanae conditor Urbis erat.
