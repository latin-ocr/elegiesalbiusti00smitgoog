oi festivity, os weddings, etc, and thus as betokening happiness and good

fortune, cp. 1, 7, 46 n. —coniugio ε ‘your union,’ both husband and wife are ⁹

meant. This seems better than Postgate's explanation oi coniugium = con·
iunx, despite the fact that Lygdamus (3, 4, 74 and 79) uses coniugium in
this not unusual sense.

¹⁹· tarda senectus: r, 10, 4o; 1, 1, 8 n.

21-22. Iwish you a long lise (avis), children (prolemque ministret), and
grandchildren (22).

22. turba novella: the adjective is regularly applied to the young of ani-
mala, ‘a brood os little ones.’

This poem, though addressed to Cornutus (2, 2, 9), really belongs to the
group (3-6) concerned with Nemesis; see Introd. p. 52-53. 'Ibis young
person has left town with a wealthy lover and is now at his country place tak-
ing part in the merriment os the vintage season. The poet was not invited.

The condition os the text has given rise to the theory (far from proved)
that this elegy was still unfinished at the time ol the poet's death.

Imitated closely by Ercole Strozzi, Amor. 1, ‘Ad Petrum Bembum de dis·
cessu amicae ab urbe.’

‘My Nemesis has gone to the country. Is there any man unfeeling enough
to stay in town now? Venus has moved to the fields and Cupid is acquiring
the ploughman's vocabulary. Oh, if I might look upon my mistress 1 would
not shrink from toiling like the veriest hind! Did not Apollo do as much for
Admetus? His glorious beauty, his wonderful music, availed him nothing,
nor could the divine healer heal himself -love will not yield to physic. This
god milked cows and made cheese with his own hands. Many a time his
sister flushed with mortification at the sight of him carrying a cali across the
fields. Many a time while he was singing in some deep dell did his bovine
audience drown out the divine singer with their bellowing. He neglected
his duties as a prophet, which brought dismay to men; he neglected his per·
sonal appearance, which nearly broke his mother’s heart. Love bade him
dwell in a lowly hut, and what to him was all the world beside?

⁴Ah, those were happy days when even the immortal gods were not ashamed
to be the slaves oi Venus! A scandalous story now. Yes,but better to be
a scandal with love than to be even a god without it. - [All sor love and the
world well lost-that was the Golden Age, indeed] - This heartless Age of
Iron is all t‘or lucre and love well lost-lucre, the cause of battle, murder,
and sudden death3 lucre, the discoverer of peril by sea; luere, the nume
oi mad extravagance.
