day luxury. His ideal is the Golden Age, when men were so
happy 3ηά so poor. He takes no part in politics, is not ambitious
to get on in affairs3 war is as unpopular with him as seafarirrg 3ηά
similar short cuts to death. He observes omens, frequently con-
sults witch-wives 3ηά Thessaliam moon specialists, 3ηά generally
makes them responsible for the sins of his mistress. She herself
has adecided leaning for ritualism. She is devoted to Isis 3ηά
sows dissension by her periodical attacks of going into retreat.

She is earnestly advised not to mar her great natural beauty by
artificial means. In the course of the affair she never fails to have
an illness. The poet nurses her 3ηά afterwards writes a poem
about it. He too falls ill. Maybe he is going to die. If so, ·
will she see to it that the following directions with regard to his

Like Anakreon he must love, 3ηά is made to sing of love alone.
To expect him to write epic is quite out of the question. Indeed
the gods themselves sometimes serve notice on him to that effect.

But while the prevailing mood of the elegy is amatory 3ηά the
lighter aspects of contemporary life are much in evidence, the
poet may, and occasionally does, resort to the other traditional
themes 3ηά moods of his department.

The Roman elegy is generally erotic an'd sentimental; it favours
the idyllic, and hasafondness forgenre. At the same time it is rarely ,
intense, and it shows a tendency to cultivated irony 3ηά persiflage.
This characteristic mood of Hellenistic poetry is especially notable
in Ovid‚ but it is also characteristic of Roman poetry in his time.

Matter aud manner are in harmony with each other. The
Roman elegy demands 3ηά attains the highest standard of formal
excellence. From this point of view—and it was this point of
view that inspired the words—Quintilian's boast of ‘elegia quoque
Graecos provocamus’ was, we may be sure, fully justified.1

11n view of much recent criticlsm of the elegy as well as of other literary
departments this characteristic attitnde ol antique criticism cannot be too often
emphasized. See p. 72, n. r. 8
