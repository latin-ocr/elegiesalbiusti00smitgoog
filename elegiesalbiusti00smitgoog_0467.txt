TIBVLLVS

divum lavore curn puer Mavortius
fundaret arcem septicollem Romulus.

It is impossible to say from which, if any, ol these passages was derived our
own familiar designation of Rome as the ‘City os the Seven Hills:

5⁶· With this line cp. Ovid, Fasti, 2, 280, ‘hic ubi nunc urbs est turn locus
urbis erat?

57-60. The poet rises well to the Sibyl’s splendid vision oi the destiny os
Rome. The idea of Rome as the mistress of the world (23 n.)‚ at once the
cause and the result oi a more definite conception of her real position in the
history oi civiiization‚ was very much in men¹s minds at this time, and was
never al'terward iorgotten; cp. Ovid, Met. 15, 8773 Fasti, 1, 85 ; 2,136; 4,
831 ; Hor. Od. 3, 3, 45; and so on down to Rutih Namat. 1, 55 l. Part
of the greatness οἱ Vergil lies in the fact that he embodied this idea lor all
time, and as no other man has ever done; cp. eg. A. 1, 276; 6, 7825 and
such modern versions as Macaulay's ‘Prophecy os Capys!

57. nomen: r'.e. Rome. ln the antique conception the name ol' a thing
not only has a power of its own, but is more closely associated with, more
actually identical with, the thing itself, than is the case with us (cp. Ovio, Met.
1, 2013 Trist. 2, 221). Ήιο world-wide idea ol' the power of a name in
magio is derived from this conception-regendis: the only ex. oi this use

in Tibullus. The dative oi the gerund and gerundive alter words of decree- l

ing and appointing‚ to give the purpose‚is restricted iu early Latin, but in-
creases in the poete, and aiter Livy, in prose. It is osten used technically.

58. Cp. in the same connection Ovid, Fasti, 1, 85, ‘Iuppiter arce sua toturn
cum spectet iu orbem, Ι nil nisi Romanum quod tueatur habet’3 2, 138,
‘quodcumque est alto sub love Caesar habet’; Hor. Carm. Sacc. 9, ‘alme
Sol, curru nitido diem qui Ι promis et celas aliusque et idern Ι nasceris, possis
nihil urhe Roma Ι visere maius! Tibullus's choice of Ceres here and oi
arvo brings out the weaith and fertility oi the Empire as well as its extent.
- prospicit: the simple ablative with prospectare is used in 1, 7, 19.

59-60. Cp. Ovid, Fasti, 2, ι 36, ‘hoc duce Romarm est solis utrumque
latus'; 4, 832, ‘sitque subhac oriens occiduusque dies’; Rutil. Namat
1, 55, ‘namsolis radiis aequalia munera tendis, Ι qua circumfusus fluctuat
Oceanus. Ι volvitur ipse tibi qui continet omnia Phoebus, Ι eque tuis ortos
in tua condit equos Ι . . . dumque oilers victis proprii consortia iuris, Ι urbem ¹
fecisti quod prius Orbis erat) ’

59. quaque patent ortus: the poet apparently has the same idea oi the
‘Gates ol' Dawn' that we find in Ovid, Met. 2, 112, ‘ecce vigil rutilo patefecit
ab ortu Ι purpureas Aurora fores et plena rosarum Ι atria: diffugiunt stellae‚'
etc.. i.e. the goddess opens the gates to let the Suu through. Elsewhere only
