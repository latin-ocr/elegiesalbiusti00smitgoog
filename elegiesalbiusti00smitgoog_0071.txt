TIBVLLVS

the one memory ol him in the phraseology ol modern English (see
1, 7, 26, n.) is ‘Jupiter Pluvius’

A scanty record lor one whom the greatest of Roman critics did
not hesitate to call ‘tersus atque maxime elegans’ among the'
elegiae poets. How shall we explain this apparent incongruity?
To answer this important question we must examine the qualities
of his genius, and get some vision ol the peculiarities olbis type
