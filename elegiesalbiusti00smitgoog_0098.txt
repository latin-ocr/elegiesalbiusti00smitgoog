INTRODUCFION

Let us take the introductory elegy ol the first book us an
illustration. Tibullus has already seen active service as a soldier.
Now his friend and patron invites him to return to lt. There is
hope ol pecuniary reward, hence a chance to recoup the fallen
fortunes ol his house3 there is also a chance to win distinction.
None oi these things is formally stated, they are merely meu·-
tioned in passing or to be inferred from the context (cp. 25-26,
5 3—54, 1-4, 41-42). Tibullus refuses to return, but not until
53-54 do we realize that he was refusing, and that the refusal

but the b'ubble reputation, the lile ol action, are nothing to

now have.

7-24. Idyllic picture ol that horne, its associations, occupa· ’

25-26. Au exclamation which takes up 1-6 again, and adds
a new motive —Give me my quiet lise 3 1 have had enough ol
the other. ¹

27-40. Second idyllic picture.

41-42. Again 1-6 with a new motive-Give me my quiet
lise ; I do not regret the loss oi my ancestral fortune, my wants
are lew.

4 3-48. Wants enumerated ; new motive ol the domina generally
stated.

49-52. Again 1-6, with the new motive suggested by the
domina just mentioned—The quiet lile forme. I would not
win the wealth os Ormus or ol Ind at the price ol breaking a
girl’s heart.

53 ff. War lor honour (not wealth) becomes a man like ·
