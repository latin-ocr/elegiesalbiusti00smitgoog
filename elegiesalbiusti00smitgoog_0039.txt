TIBVLLVS

one of the few great poets of Rome born in Latium itself and of

the old Latin stock. .

Ι The poet's family consisted of his mother and his sister (1, 3,
3 ft),andwe1earn from Ovid, Amores, 3, 9, 49 ff, the famous

elegy upon his death,1 that they both survived him. As he never

mentions his father, we conclude that he must have died before his

, son was old enoughtoretain anydistinctimpressionof him(1,r,2n.).

Like other boys of his position, he was doubtless sent ro Rome
to acquire the usual rhetorical-legal education of the time. He
may even have taken some part, as did Horace, in university
life at Athens. All this however is mere surmise. For us, and ap-
parently for him, the most important fact in his entire carceris
his connection with his lifelong patron and friend, M. Valerius
Messalla Corvinus (64 rac-8 aaa).

This distinguished member of an ancient and most distinguished
³ family was as famous 'for his literary as for his administrative ability.
After the murder of Julius, Messalla sided with Brutus and Cassius,
and though barely twenty-two at the time, was made commander
of the right wing at Philippi. Upon the death of Brutus and Cassius,
and the utter rout of their army, the soldiers who had escaped
rallied to Messalla and chose him as their general. With rare but
characteristic good sense he persuaded them to surrender. He then
joined Antony, but was soon alienated by the conduct of Cleopatra,
and finally went over to Octavianus. He was ¹at once admitted
to the fullest confidence by that wonderful. judge of men, and
thenceforth supported him with unswerving loyalty to the end of
his days, first irr Sicily in 36, then against the Salassi in 34, then at
Actium, where he commanded the centre of the fleet, having been
chosen consul in place of Antony.

Soon after the victory at Actium (Appian, B. C. 4, 38) he was
dispatched to Aquitania to quell a serious insurrection among the

lTrans. by Stepney‚ Johnson's English Pacis, 17, 226. Another and better
version is that of Nichol (in Cranstoun's T rans. of Tibullus). The poem was not
intended to be biographical and should not be used for that purpose.
