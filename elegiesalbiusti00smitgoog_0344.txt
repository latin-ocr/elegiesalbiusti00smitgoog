NOTES [1, 7, 59

This use ol Mopsopiur ior Attic (first in Tib. l) is quoted as Kallimachean
by Stephan. Byz. 458, 14, cp. Kallimach. frag. 351 Schn.

5⁶. veneranda: passive, 1, 5, 14 n. Amplilies the idea ol 'quae iacta
parentis augeat,’ ‘sons worthy ol their sire’ Α wish often expressed, Hor.
A. P. 24; Sen. Agant. 4o6; Naevius, frag. Trag. 15R(quoted by Cicero,
Fam. 15, 6, ις 5,12‚7; Tusc. Disput. 4, 67); Herod. 1, 30 (the famous
story ol Solon and Kroisos) ; etc.

57-58. Introd. p. 35. atter the Civil Wars Angustus himself assumed the
task ol repairing the Via Flaminia as lar as Ariminum andapportioned others
to the different generals who had been given triumphs, the· expense in each
case to be delrayed ex manubiali patienia, the money realized from the spoils
of the campaign (Sueton. Aug. 303 Cassius Dio, 53, 22). Messalla’s task
here referred to was a portion oi the Via Latina which diverging to the leit
after leaving the Porta Capena passed between Tusculum on the left and the
Alban Hills on the right and proceeded southward until it finally joined the
Via Appia at Beneventum.

57. taceat: agrees with the implied antecedent oi quem. -ntonumenta
viae: for the genitive oi specification cp. 2, 5, 33; 2,6, 3; 1, 8, 47; 1,
10, 3; 1, 4, 103 1, 6, 86; 2‚4,29; 4, 6, 5. In 2, 5, 43 Numicius is
felt to be agod, hence the gen. is possessive. monumenta may be used as
here oi any memorial to one's seli (monere), especially ol public works,
Cicero, Mil. 173 Varro, L. L. 6, 49, etc -quem detinet: 1 ,3 3.- -Tusaula
tellus· Mart. 9, 60, 2 uses ‘tellus Tuscula!

58. candida Albaz the grey hmestone oi the neighbourhood when seen ιιι
the bright sunlight quite justifies the epithet. Servius on Verg. G. 3, 82,

‘candidum id est, quadam nitenti luce perfusum,’ hence the favourite tropic
use as in 64 below. For candidus thus used of natural objects, Propert. 3,
16, 3, cp. Hor. Sat. 1, 5, 26; Epod. 1, 29, etc.

59-60. Vitruvius the engineer, a contemporary oi Messalla himself, tells us
how a Roman road was made. ‘First the earth was levelled and rammed
down until it was solid: then came alayer oi rough stenes ior a foundation,

with or without cement: above this a second layer os rubble, mixed with lime
(glarea, 59) and rammed down to a thickness ol nine inches: on the top os
all was a layer os hard pavement stones (silex, 60, a general term for any hard
rock, cp. Juv. 6, 350, etc.) usually of basaltic lava, laid caresully on a bed
oi hard cement’ (Ramsay). This method which has made the Roman roads
deservedly famous in all succeeding times had already been followed sor
generations in the time oi Augustus, cp. Livy, 41, 27, 5 (174 aa).

Then as now the silices or paving stones (Ital. salci) were very nicely fitted
though often os irregular sbape.
