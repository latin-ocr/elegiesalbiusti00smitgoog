NOTES [1, 3, 79

Fur. 756, Agam. 18, Herc. Oet. 947, Phaed. 1233, 0111116221 plural in
Ovid, Met. 10, 43, Ibis, 1943 Seneca, Herc. Oet. 1071, Thyest. ro. The
variation combined with the extensive use oi the poetic plural in these authors
shows that no cerfiaiu conclusion can be drawn. Iu the famous painting 01

Hades by Polygnotos (Pausan. 10, 29, 3) the vultures were not represented.
In some versione, now lost, serpents were tormentors instead of vultures (Hygia.
Fal. 55). - viscere: poet. and indes. for iecur, cp. Ovid, Met. 4, 457, Seneca,
Thyest.1o,etc. For the sing. see dictt. The punishment fitted the crime,
ior, as is well known, the liver, aec. to antique theory, was the seat 01 the
passions, cp. Hor. Od. 3, 4, 77, ‘incontinentis nec Tityi iecur 1 reliquit ales,
nequitiae additus Ι 1111101’, 4, 1, 12 (to Venus) ‘si torrere iecur quaeris ido·
neum.’ So osten in the Elizabethan writers, eg. ‘Did all the shastsin thy
t'air quiver Ι Stick fast in my ambitious liver, Ι Yet thy power would 1 adore Ι

And call upon thee to shoot more! (Fletcher’s Nice Valour.) Apollodoros,
1, 23 says it was the heart oi Tityos, not the liver.

77-78. Νο punishment isso osten mentioned as that of Tantalos. Three
methods of punishment, designed respectivcly to produce thirst, hunger, and
mortal terror, are met with. The first two are described by Homer, Odyss. 11,
582, q.v. Tibullus selecta the first; so Propert. 2, 17, 5, 4, 11, 24, Ovid,
Met. 10, 41, Hor. Sat. 1, 1, 68, Seneca, Medea, 745, Agam. 19 and 7693
Octav. 621, Stat. Theb. 4, 538, 8, 51, cte. Agaiu, only the second is chosen,
asin Properta, 1,66, Ηο1. Epod. 17, 66,but thiais not common. Most
frequently we have, as in Homer, the first two, cp. eg. the characteristically
'rhetorical description in Seu. Thyest. 152-175, others are Ovid, Met. 4, 457,
Amor. 2, 2, 43, Ibis, 1793 Sen. Herc. Fur. 752, Herc. Oet. 1075, Petron.
82, Stat. Theb. 6, 280, etc. The third, the punishment oi the overhauging
stone, is more characteristic oi lyric and tragic poetry, appearing first (so
Pausan. 10, 31, 12) in Archilochos, cp. frag. 50 Crus.; Alkaios, frag. 76
Crus.; Pind. Olymp. 1, 56, Isthm. 8, 10, Eurip. Orest. 5, Plato, K ratyl. 395
D; Cicero, ruse. Disput. 4, 35, Fin. 1, 60, Lucret 3, 981, Seneca, Thyest.
76; etc.

All three were represented in the picture 01 Polygnotos (Pausan. 10, 31,
12) and each gave rise to popular proverbs or phrases, cp. eg. Ταντάλου
seluo, δίψος, δίψα· δένδρεα Ταντάλου, Ταντάλου κήπους τρυγᾶν· ὀΤαντάλου
Miles ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς ταλαντεύεται, etc.

79-80. In the picture 01 Polygnotos this proverbially endless and bootless
task was given to the ἀμύητοι, those who had neglectcd the rites of initiation
(Plato, Rep. 363 1), Gorg. 493 Β, etc). Christian superstition allotted the
same punishment to the unbaptized. 11 does not appear in connection with
the Danaides until the Axioch. 371 E. The identification tested ou the idea
