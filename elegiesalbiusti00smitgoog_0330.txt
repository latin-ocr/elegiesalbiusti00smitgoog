the Pyrenees and enters the Mediterranean just above Narbo Martius, the
modern Narbonne. Rivers seem to have appealed to the Roman poets more
than did any other detail of natural landscape. The epithets they give them

usually betray genuine observation and they often describe them (cp. the ’

Mosella of Ausonius) con amore. The national point of view is often shown
for instance as here by the widespread practice of personifying a country or a
district, not by its geographical or ethnographical name, but by the living,
moving feature in its landscape, i.e. by the principal river within its borders,
cp. lines 11, 12, 13, and 22, below, etc. So among the numerous allegorical
‘floats’ by which the gorgeous spectacle of a Roman triumph was habitually
adorned a prominent place was always given to the rivers which had belonged
to the conquered taces, Ovid, Ars Antat. 1, 219; Trist. 4, 2, 375· Tac.

worship, the fulfilment of the vows which the triumphator bad made to the
Capitoline'Jove before starting upon his campaign. Indeed from that time
until his return· to, the Capitol he was actually the representative of the Capi·
toline Jove. The processioa was formed outside the city as a rule and entered
hythe Porta Triumphalis on the borders of the Campus Martius. Here it
was met by the senate and citizens and proceeded to the Capitol, which was
the goal of the ceremony.· The procession was headed by the senate and
officials of the state, then came the mnsicians and aster the'rn a long line -as
long as possible-of spoils taken from the enemy, allegorica} floats, distin·

roaring out ribald songs upon their general to protect him from the evil eye in
this honr of his dangerously good fortune, and finally the triumphator himself
with all the insignia of his divine prototype on the Capitol, in achariot of gold
and ivory drawn by four white horsea (l. 8 below; Propert. 1, 16, 3; 4, 1, 32;

the ivory sceptre surmounted by an eagle was in his hand, and he wore the
triumphator’s toga of purple and gold. Upon reaching the Capitol he dis-
mounted and walked up, or, if he was feeling sufficiently superstitious, crept
up, the steps to the shrine where he offered to the god his laurel crown (1. 7 ;
2,5,117; Ovid,Amor.2,12,1; Consoladliv. 3343 etc). Frequently too
he offered the fasces, the insignia of his rank, or a palm branch. Then
followed a sacrifice and afterward a banquet in the temple, in which the
senate and the officials of the state partoolr with the triumphator.
