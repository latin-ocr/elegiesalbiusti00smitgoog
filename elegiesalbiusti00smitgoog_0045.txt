TIBVLLVS

. forms, and rivalry, even il we were obliged. to grant its existence,
was not necessarily actuated by political preferences.

'Our testimony sor the character and personality of Tibullus is
for the most part indirect. The vita says that he was ‘cultu
corporis observabilis! An unimportant detail perhaps in itsels
and possibly due to a misunderstanding of such passages as
2, 3, 77 ff„ but we cau hardly doubt its literal truth. A man so

notoriously fastidious in his literary style is likely to have been
equally fastidious iu everything else—from the set os a toga
to the choice oi a friend. Nor does fastidiousness conduce to*
rapid and extensive literary productiori, and Tibullus’s plea for
same, at all events as it now stands, is hardly more bullry than the
slim little booldet offered by his predecessor Catullus.

The testimony oi hisworlrs—and it is confirmed by Horace-is
all to the effect that Tibullus was a man os unusual tendernesS, re-
finement, and breeding. Even when subjected to such a severe
test as the treatment of those conventional themes of the elegy
with which he habitually deah, he rarely fails to ring true. From
this point os view no Roman poet could have been a more con·
’ genial companion to the gentle and high-souled Vergil in his
journey to the Elysian Fields. Without the same genius there
was nevertheless the same fastidiousness‚ sense os proportion, and
classic reserve, even the same tendency to live in the past and to
dwell upon the glory and the beauty os other days.

Praise os ‘the mean that ’grees with country music best' is
os course characteristic os the elegy, above all os the idyllic type
affected by Tibullus. Nevertheless Horace’s description os his
friend as

tacitum silvas iuter reptare salubris
curantem quidquid dignum sapiente bonoque est,

can only apply toa poet whose love sor the simple life aod sur·
roundings of his boyhood days is quite as genuine and unaffected
as his own words would have us believe.
