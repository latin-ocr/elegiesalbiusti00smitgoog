reading here adopted has the merit of involving no drastic emendation and
the translation of it as ‘always on the eve of some untimelyjourney' seems an l
entirely natural development of the thought of the preceding line. Naturally .
the phrase is not to be taken literally nor (as some of the old commentators ¹
seem to have supposed) is it at all descriptive of Messalla's actual habit. It y
is merely the overstatement of temporary irritation on account of this one r
’ particular journey.-nett tempestivae: really = the compound intempestivae. 7

propinque: ‘neat to,’ ⁸ on the point of,' ie. vocative of the adjective referring .

to Messalla. For the use of propinquus in this secondary sense, Lucan, 6, 1,
‘postquam castra duces pugnae iarn mente propinqui {imposuere iugis’ has
been quoted, but Lucan's use elsewhere suggests that pargnac may go with
mente and hence that propinqui is literal, cp. 9, 225, ‘quorum unus aperta Ι
mente fugae tali compellat voce regentem.’—viae: is taken here as the
genitive with propinque, a Greek construction for which Wunderlich cites
ἐγγὺς elvat τινός.
7. The thought, which is characteristic of lovers the world over, is an
’ especial favourite with Plautus, cp. Aul. 181, ‘nam egomet sum hic, animus
domi est’; cist. 211, ‘ubi sum ibi non sum, ubi non sum ibi est animus’;

Merc. 589, ‘si domi sum' foris est animus, sin foris sum animus domist'; 7
Amphit. 1081, etc.; Lutat. Catulus ap. Gell. 19, 9, 14, ‘aufugit mi animus; ¹

credo, ut solet, ad Theotimum Ι devenit. sic est: perfugium illud hahet!
-animttm sensusque: my mind and heart, all of me that thinks and feels,
cp. Cicero, Sest. 47, ‘at alii dicerent animos hominum sensusque morte
restingui'; Orat. 3, 673 Pliny, 35, 98, 'is omniurn primus animum pinxit
et sensus hominis expressit quae vocant Graeci ilfa!

8. arbitrio meo: ‘at my own disposal,’ ‘to do as 1 wish,' cp. Publilius
Syrus, 5, ‘amor animi arbitrio sumitur, nou ponitur'; Caes. B. G. 7, 75, 5,
‘se suo nomine atque arbitrio . . . bellum gesturos,’ etc—quamvis, eto:
ie. ‘at least my heart is free and 1 leave it here with Cerinthus, although you,
Messalla, do not allow,’ etc-quamvis: with the indicative as here and
Lygd. 3, 6, 29 (not elsewhere in the Tib. corpus) is occasioual in Lucretius
and Varro, the Augustan poets (Propert. 1, 18, 13, 2, 8, ²73 24, 373 3,19,
28; more frequent in Ovid, eg. Amor. 1, 15,14; 2, 5, 60; 3, 13, 53 and
Her. 7, 29; 13, 119; 18, 503 Ars Amat. 2, 213; Mel. 2, 782 etc. (Verg. E. 3,
845 A. 5, 542; 7, 492; etc), Petronius, Seneca, and Late Latin. Cicero and
the Scriptores Historiae Augustae always use the subjunctive. Some authors,
eg. Caesar, Sallust, and Livy (except 2, 40, 7, once and with the indic),
avoid quamvis altogether with verbs—esse: for the omission of the subiect
see 2, 6,13n.
