TIBVLLVS

Cerinthus to proceed as he has begun. On this side is the mere
common drudge, the lowest even in her own class 3 on this is
‘Servi lilia Sulpicia! This is not amere outburst of iealous fury.
There is no roorn for jealousy here. Nor is the fierce scorn for
the woman herself ; she is not to blame. It is for CerinthuS, that
he could stoop so low; it is the bitter cryof her own humiliation.
To be sure the situation is slightly modified by the last two
lines (5-6), although no rigid and detailed interpretation of them
is altogether free from objection. The main drift however of
this truly feminine parting shot is clear enough, quite as clear at

it that she did not lack for consolation. ⁵

Ptobably the temporarily despised recipient of this missive

know that onthis occasion Cerinthus, though doubtless utterly be-
wildered, must have explained himself to her entire satisfaction.
Indeed who shall say that the deuouement of 4, 7 was not perhaps
precipitated hythe inevitable revulsion of feeling arising from her
conviction that the accusation of 4, ιο was entirely unfounded?

At all events 4, 7, the last of this series, was evidently written
just after the consummation of her love, for she is still in a highly
