forced to devour raw meat wherever she finds it and mix her drinlr with gall
for want of the usual wine’ (so Dissen). The explanationis'nct sufficient3
moreover the poet takes up the curse of hunger further down. 'l’o be sure,
like many of the traditional punishments of Hades, the curse figures the
crime. sanguineae dapes are a fitting reward for the death of the innocent
lovers whom her cruelty has murdered. So, too, the lovers' cup of gall is a
commonplace of erotic poetry, eg. Plaut. cist. 69, ‘amor et melle et felle est
fecundissimus,' the bitter-sweet of love, Sappho’s γλυκύπικροςἘρωι, which
has beena proverb in all ages. But the reward ο1 the lena shall be the cup
ο1 gall untempered with sweet. Τ1ιε point, however, of this bizarre and
horrid curse is that the woman shall run mad. The mention here of blood
and gall rests upon the superstition that blood as wellas gall when drunlr
has just this effect. See the references in Oppenheimer’s article (mentioned
below), and cp. Machetle, 1, 5, ‘Come to my woman’s breasts, Ι And take my
milk for gall, you murdering ministers, Ι Wherever in your sightless sub-
stances Ι You walt on nature’s mischief 1’ For the most recent discussions of
this curse see Reitzenstein, Poimandres, p. 200, ιι. 3 and Oppenheimer,
Ἀραι, Wiener Studien, 1908, p. 146, with references.

50. tristia: the translation of tristis should be gnided by the fact that in
one way or another the word usually suggests facial expression, cp. esp.

, Verg. G. 2, 247. Here it is active (1, 1, 8 ιι.) and the pictoresque substitute

of amarus3 cups, as it were, that pnclrer one's face. So we may say a ‘sour-
faced’ man, ie. a man whose expression suggests that he has just swallowed
something sour.

51. 'Ibat is, the lovers who have been brought to death by her cruelty. The
ghosts of those we have injured come back from the grave to haunt us; cp.
2, 6, 37 ιι. ; Hor. Epod. 5, 91, ‘quin ubi perire iussus exspiravero, Ι nocturnus
occurram Furor Ι petamque vultus umbra curvis unguibus, Ι quae vis deorum
est manium, Ι et inquietis adsidens praecordiis Ι pavore somnos auferam’;
Ovid, Ibis, 1413 Verg. A. 4, 3853 Val. Flacc. 3, 3843 Stat. Theb. 3, 743 esp.
Ammian. Marcell. 14, 11, 17.-fata: 4, 4, 11 ιι. .

52. stactis . . . canat: ¹ominons to the last degree and much dreaded

by the Romans. Any owl is the herald par excellence of disaster, ‘foeda‘

volucris,’ as Ovid says (Met. 5, 549), ‘venturi nuntia luctus, Ι ignavus bubo
dirum mortalibus omen' ς cp. ng. ‘lt was the owl that shrielr’d, the fatal

bellman, Ι Which gives the stern’st good-night.’— Macbeth. But the matteris ἓ
trebly omlnous if, as here, the owl lights upon one’s own ιοο1 ; cp. eg. Propert. ᾗ
4, 3, 59, and esp. Pliny, 10, 34, ‘bubo funebris et maxime abominatus publicis Ι
praecipue auspiciis deserta incolit nec tantum desolata sed dira etiam et in· ¹

accessa, noctis monstrum, nec cantu aliquo vocalis sed gemitu. itaque in
