choream as in Verg. A. 6, 644; Propert. 2, 19, 15, otherwise choreae, as
eg. in t, 7, 49.

60. ¹aves: wehear of birds in Elysium 11 Lulrian, Vera Hist. 2, 5 and 14. 11
his elegy on the death of Corinna's parrot (Amor. 2, 6, 49) Ovid hopes there is
a place for the good birds in Elysium and proceeds to describe it. Birds and
their songare a touch in descriptions of nature characteristic of the elegiae
poetacp. Ovid, Amor. 1, 13, 8; 3, 1, 4 ; Fasti, 1, 1553 1, 4413 3, 173
Trist. 3, 11, 8 ; 1111113, 1, 11; etc. 1n the numerous mediaeval and Renais·
sance descriptione of Paradise or Fairyland they are rarely forgotten.

61. casiam: so Verg. E. 4, 25, ‘Assyrium volgo nascetur amomum,' and
often. -non emta: 101 the significance of these words cp. lines 45-46 above
with note-seges: 222. ager, so 1, to, 353 4, 2, 18; Verg. G. 1, 473 etc.

62. rosis: no other flower was so much loved in antiquity nor has any other
been adorned with so much symbolism by the classic fancy (see Charles Joret‚
La Rose dans I’Antiquite‘ et au Moyen Age). The flowers are rarely forgotten in
descriptions of Elysium, cp. eg. Pind. Olymp. 2, 79 ; [Plato] Axioch, 371 C;
Greek epitaph (Kaibel, 649, 3), ἔνθα κατ’ Ἠλυσίων πεδίων σκίρτωσα ’γέγηθας
Ι ἄνθεσιν ἐν μαλακοῖσι κακῶν ἔκτοσθεν ἁπάντων· Carne. 14113111. 525, 53 Stat.
Silv. 5, 1, 2573 etc. But it is especially fitting that in this place we should

find the rose which is the symbol of beauty, youth, and love, cp. Propert. 4,
7, 603 Pind. frag. 129, ²3 Lulrian, Vera Hirr, 2, 5 and 63 etc. Ι

63-64. 11 Elysium one pursues the tastes and avocatione of one's former
life undisturbed and without satiety, cp. esp. Verg. Α. 6, 642; Pind. frag.
1²9 B. Hence the reward 01 the lover in this classical prototype 01 Mahomet's

Paradise is happy love according to the conventional ideal 01 earthly life as
set forth hythe elegiae poets (eg. 1, 10, 53-58; 1,1,73-74). imitated by
SannazarO, Arcadia, p. 107, ed. Scherillo (Milan, 1888).

64. proelia miscet: 1 military phrase. Amor stands near and directs the
¹ campaign, hence, proelia instead 01 the more usual rixae, 101 which see 1, 1,
74 n., and the parallel 01 this distich, 1, 10, 57-58.

6⁶. myrtea serta: the myrtle was sacred to Venus (Ovid, Fasti, 4, 1393
Serv. on Verg. E. 7, 61, ete), hence, the appropriateness of tt here, cp. Verg.
A. 6, 441 (lugentes Campi). But the myrtle, perhaps for this very reason,
is more or less regularly associated with Elysium, cp. Carni. Epig. B. 492,
12, etc. The influence 01 some Orphic symbolism is possible and hasbeen
claimed, cp. Aristoph. Ran. 156; Pherekrat. 108, 25, K.

67—8a.· Elysium, the reward 01 faithful lovers, suggests by contrast Tar-
taros, in which the poet hopes that a place is prepared for his rival. The
