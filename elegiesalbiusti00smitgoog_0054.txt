Die vrouwen haben langez har
Unt kurz gemuete, daz ist wfir.

For though Delia is ‘sweet,' and may have loved the poet as well
as she could love any one, ber head is not strong, she has no real
stability, she is easily led. She does not belong to the aggressive
type oi Cynthias Without strong passions of any sort she belongs

to that vwidespread and generally popular class of women whom
one might describe as the passive recipients of attention. In
short the portrait ol her is both conventional and typical, but how
much of the conventionality was inherent in the model, and how
much was due to the painter, it is impossible to say.

But while there is no chronological sequence of events in these
elegies, it is significant of the poet’s art that, from the absolute
trust of the first to the complete disillusion of the last elegy, the
cmotrhnal sequence, the psychologr'cal development, and its effect
upon the persons concerned, are at once complete and convincing.

In the first three elegies Tibullus is tender as well as passionate.
Naturally ,refined and fastidious, he slurs over the¹ ugly phases
of his affair so skilsully that we almost forget the real situation.
He pictures himself thinking of Delia, not only as a mistress but
also as a friend and helpmeet—in other words as a wife. Il.

, this was the way that he really treated her, she was doubtless

pleased, but scarcely wise enough to appreciate it. Indeed to
judge from the probable training and surrounding's of her early
lile, she would be likely to end by finding the atmosphere
somewbat too rar'efied for her real tastes That women are
occasionally of a coarser and far more primitive libre than they

had appeared to be is sometimes betrayed by the marriages they
’ make. So Delia, in addition to the mere excitement of an
intrigue to vary the monotony of what, it must⁴ be confessed,
would -he a very dull life to us, may have lound no little relies
in the brutal franlmess, the material tastes, the limited range
of ideas, and the unlimited purse of the rich lover by whom
her separation from the poet was finally brought to pass.
