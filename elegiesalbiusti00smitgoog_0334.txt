NOTES · [1‚ 7, 20

quanam . . . quibus! An indirect disjunctive questipn is found only in 4, 5,
20. For the indicio indirect quest. see 2, 4, mnf—crebras urbes: ie.
‘populous' ‘picturing the crowded streets characteristic of an Oriental city’
(Schulze). In other words crebras urbes is not, as it were, ‘frequent cities,’
but ‘cities frequented,’ sc. ‘with inhabitants! As a rule creber in this sense is
accompanied by a determining word. For the absolute use, however, the
Tbesaurus av. cites ctess Quint. Frat. 2, 11, 4, (speaking of Philistus) ‘creber,
acutus, brevis’; Quintil, 2, 5, 8, ‘quam subtilis et crebra argumentatio’3
Pliny, Epist. 1, 20, 22, ‘orationem similem nivibus hibernis, id est crebram et
assiduam et largam! It will be observed, however, that in these exx. creber
is not literal and that it is used only to designate a quality of style.

18. Syro: as used hy the classical writers Syria is a general term. When,
therefore, it was necessary to be specific, an adjective had to be added, as
here Palaestinas, so, eg. Ovid, Ars Amat. 1, 416; Pliny, 5, 663 12, 80, etc.

19. The island of Tyre, like the island of Manhattan, was quite too small
for the enormous business carried on there together with the people who
chose to inhabit it. lt was therefore famous for its-high buildingi, ware-
houses, palaces, etc, eg. Strabo, 16, 757, ematuruerit reivers-vous τὰς ot·
etus ὥστεκαὶ τῶν ἐν Ῥώμῃ μᾶλλον. Tibullus’s line seems to apply with pecu·
liar fitness to the city that ‘rose tier upon tier from the blue waters of the
Midiand Sea! For the wealth and power of theold city, cp. Erekiel, 27
and 28.-maris aequor: aequor or aequora of thesea is always poetic from
Ennius down, though occasional in prose after Seneca the Elder. ponti or
maris aequor appears first with Lucretius (2, 781; Verg. Α. 1, 511; etc).
maris aequor as a technical term = ‘the level of the sea’ is found in Colum.
8, 17, 3 and 4. Cases with a long final syllable are naturally excluded from
dactylic verse. The ablat. plural (once in Cicero) is used first by Tibullus
among the poeta, 2, 5, 80, then Propert. 1, 8, 205 r,14,12; Hor. Od. 4, 4,
543 8, 32, and occasionally later. The dat. plur. is extremely rare. Tennyson
(Morte d'Artkur) says ‘shining levels of the lake,’ after aequora ponti as in
Verg. G. 1, 4693 Lucret. 1, 8, etc. (Mustard).-prospectet turribus:
‘prospicere de caelo) iu 2, 5, 58. The use of apreposition in this cons. is
largely a matter of choico-turribus: for turres of high buildings or palaces,
cp. Propert. 3, 21, ¹5? Verg. A. 2, 460; Hor. Od.1,4, 143 Epod 17, 7ο;
etc, the occasional use of ‘Towers’ in the names of country places in
England, etc.

20. Reflects the fame of the old Phoenician navigators and is repeated
eg. by Lucan, 3, 2175 Pliny, 5, 67; Curtius, 4, 4,19; Dionys. Perieg. 907
(cp. Priscian, Perieg. 848).-credere docta: the infinitive with adjectives
or participles isaGreelr construction found in all the Augustan poets, esp.
