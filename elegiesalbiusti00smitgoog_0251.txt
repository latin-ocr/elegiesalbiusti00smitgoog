idea, largely due to the Cynica and Stoica, that the downlall of man hasbeen
accomplished largely by his own discoveries and inventions. 'i'he iavourite
examples are those chosen by Aratos. They are the first sword (cp. 1, 10,
1 1, esp. 47 s. below and notes) and the first ship. Even outside, however, ol
its use in this connection the diatriba on navigatlon was alreadysully devel-
oped in the poetry ot' Hesiod, it was a conventional theme oi the Greek epi-
gram at all periods, a regular motive in the poetry of the Augustan age, and
by the first century of our era a mere rhetorical commonplace; cp. Stobaios,
57, and, among extended passages, Sophokles, Anagone, 332; Seneca, Medea,
. 30¹3 607; Ovid, Amor. 2, 11, 1; Properat, 17, 133 3, 7, ²9³ Statius, iheb.
6, 193 Achill. 1, 62; Claudiarl, De Rape. Pras. 1, Praestat. The argument ulti·
mately rests, for the most part, on the axiom that the gods created manto
live on the solid earth. ‘Terrestre animal homo‚’ says Columella, 1, Praesat.
8(cp. Propert. 3, 7, 343 Ovid,Amor.2,11,30; Statius, Sila. 3, 2, 62; Sil.
Ital. 11, 4703 Lucan, 6, 401, etc). In his natural state, therefore, ie. in the
Golden Age, he remained on shore. Hence, as the poet says in this passage
(cp. 2, 3, 39), there was no seasaring in the¹ Golden Age (Hesiod, W. and

D. ²3⁶3 Aratos, 1103 Ovid, Met. 1, 943 Propert. 3, 7, 313 Ovid, Anwr. 3, 8, 43
and 49; Seneca, Phaed. 5303 Medea, 329; N. Q. 5,18,11; Verg. G. 1, 1303
E. 4, 32; Hor. Od. 1, 3213 Epod 16, 59, Manilius, 1, 77, etc). Sea·
lating, then, violatea the law oi nature and of the gods (Hor. Od. 1, 3, 23;

Propert. 1, 17, 133 Columella, 1, Praesat. 8, Seneca, Medea, 328, eto),
and is therefore impious (Seneca, Medea, 3405 605; 66& Lucan, 3,193;
Val. Flaccus, 1, 6053 627; 8003 Claudiau, In Rufi 1, 219; Hor. l.c.‚·
etc). Every ship is in itsell an insult to the sea, a deliberate challenge 10 an
almighty power; cp. contempserat in 37 heightened by the equally foolhardy
actos 383 Ovid, Mel. 1, 141, etc. Further, the notive ot' scalaring is greed
oi gain (39-4o; 1, 9, 93 2, 3, 393 Eurip. Iphig. Taur. 4103 Kallimachsrag.
111, Schn.; SenMed. 361; N. Q. 5, 18, 14; etc), an unworthy motive. 'So
one sin begot another, and this is the moral of Propert. 3, 7. Not only then
is death by the sea an unnatoral death, being brought upon man by his own
device (503 Propert. 3, 7, ²93 Seneca, N. Q. 5, 18, 8; Ovid, Amor. 3, 8,
45; Verg. E. 4, 38; Pliny,H. N. 19, 53 eto), but it isa punishment-often
exacted by the sea itseli (Propert. 3, 7, 22 and 33). Indeed, thesea deliber·
ately seeks to entrap men through their sinsul desiree, ‘natura insidians pon·
tem substravit avaris,' says Propert. 3, 7, 37 (aster Lucretius, 2, 557; cp. 5,
1004), etc. The seaisgreedy to destroy (Hor. od. 1, 28, 18; 3, 29, 61;
Propert. 3, 7, 14 and 18) and utterly without metcy (Homer, Iliad, 16, 34,
γλαυκὴ δέ σε τίκτε θάλασσα Ι πέτραι τ’ ἠλίβατοι, ὅτι τοι ahos ἐστὶν ἀπηνής·
Lucretius, 2, 1155; Lygd. 3, 4, 85). Itis proverbially perilous (a savonrite
