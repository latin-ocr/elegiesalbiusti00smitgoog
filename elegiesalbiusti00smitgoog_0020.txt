even in the scanty fragments of these early poets. The four lead· ⁸
ing moods-threnodic, hortatory, erotic, didactic (θρηνητική, προ
τρεπτική, ἐρωτική, διδακτική) —are all represented. Now too, as
throughout the entire history of the department, the poet’s atti-
tude is preferably subjective, but the objective attitude of the epic
or dramatic poet as we see it in the narrative elegy had already

begun. Even the realistic vein of Asios (see Athenaios, 3, 125, D)
appeared again in the Alexandrian poets and certain of their Roman
imitators. The same is true of style and technique. These are

generally determined by the Ionian epic. Hence the certain .

amount of elevation and dignity ever afterwards characteristic of
the type. So in their manipulation of the distich these old Ionian
masters exhibit the same tendency to ¹develop an idea by parallel-
ism and antithesis which we find in the later poetS, especially
Tibullus himself. ,

The overshadowing genius of this period is Archilochos of Paros,
but taking the subsequent history of the department as awhole,
the most interesting and by far the most important representative
of this school of elegy, perhaps even of the entire elegy, is
Mimnermos of Kolophon.

Mimnermos‚ like Kallinos, used the distich as a vehicle of
patriotic feeling. He also betrays a fondness for local legends.
But his most important contribution to elegiae art is the sen-
timental-erotis mood characterizing the poems to his beloved
Nanno. Equally important is the fact that he does not express
emotion after the manner of the Aeolic lyric. He either analyzes
it, presents it rhetorically, as in the old gnomic poetry, or illus·
trates it by a parallel taken from myth. These methods of de-
velopment, especially this peculiar and characteristic use of myth,
make the Nanno, as every student of Propertius knova, a proto·
type of the Hellenistic elegy (cp. Hor. Epist. 2, 2, ror, Propert.
1, 9, 11).

A singer and a player of the flute as wellas a poet, Mimnermos
was also especially notable for his use of epic forms. , We might
