characteristic oi poetry. The order ol the words has a strong tendency to
remain fixed. Changes begin with the classical writers, in whom they are
dictated by a finer feeling for euphony, and in the poets, with whom the in·
fluence ol metre is to be considered.

Archaic Latin uras the period os its greatest popularity. But even Plautus
uses it far more than Terence, and fondness sor it diminished rapidly at the
end ol the Republic, although Cicero appears to have invented some new
phrases which he bequeathed to later prose. The avoidance of it as a rule
by Tacitus and even by Quintilian (a great lover of Cicero) shows that many
such expressions had been done to death by over-use. New lise was given by
Fronto and the Archaists, and it always clung to the folk speech, cp.
Tertullian, who in the use of such expressions is the most notable of all the
Church Fathers.

Alliteration, however, asa distinctive ornament oi poetry covers a much
wider field. Here one os the most interesting phenomena is the use of triple
alliteration in the second hals os the hexameter (see Whlfflin, Archiv fl Lat.
lexicographie, 14, 515-523). The single example in the elegy isTib. 1, 10, 43,
‘caput candescere canis) This device was, characteristic of the Saturnian
(cp. ‘obliti sunt Romae loquier latina lingua,’ one of three similar verses in the
lour lines of Naevius's epitaph), was taken over from thence by Ennius sor the
artistic epic and thus became a tradition os the higher style ln later times.
The comparative frequency ol it in the Aeneid is merely another indication
oi Vergil’s well-known Ennian proclivities. Wolfflin cites no less than 14 exx.
from the Aeneid (2, 3033 28; 3, 58; 183; 4, 295 7,189; 48²3 486; 8, ⁶033
9, 5⁶33 6353 10, 95; 1945 11, 348), and the feeling sor it at this time is
shown by the fact that Ovid never uses it except in passages for which a
flavour oi the antique and solemn is appropriate (eg. Met. 2, 773 6, 667; 10,
4925 7²³³ arssu swa 1s‚84; 933 15224)· But it was already sadins
out and the occasional reappearance os it in the later epic is more due to
Vergil than to Ennius (eg. Lucan, 1, 3533 Val. Flacc. 3, 441, of solemn ritual;
3, 333 Sil. Ital. 5, 324; Stat. Theb. 2, 584, cp. 2, 443; ro, 193 and 375;
Avienus, 2, 573). Servius on Verg. A. 3, 183, says, ‘haec compositiciam viti-
osa est quae maioribus placuit‚’ (cp. Mart. Capella, 171, 22 Eyssenh. ‘vitanda
sunt ab isdem litteris incipientia ¹). As Wolfflin suggests, this note of Servius
was occasioned by one os these lines, and he doubtless refers to this type
rather than to alliteration in general. That Tibullus should supply the
single example to be found in the entire elegy is an interesting illustration of
his conservatism and still another proot' os his kinship with Vergil. Perhaps
this type is more or less distantly responsible sor the tendency os alliteration
(as Keller has observed) to appear in the last two feet os the verse. This
