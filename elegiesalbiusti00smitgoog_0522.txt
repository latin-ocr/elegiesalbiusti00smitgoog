ough examination of the poem from every point of view. His main argu·
ments are -

1. Inferiority. Throughout the poem the thought or, what is not less
noteworthy‚ the turn of the thought, is either trivial or else different from
what we look for in Tibullus.

2. Coincidences iu phrase, etc, with the known work of Tibullus show
nothing characteristic of the poet. The Tibullian note of distinction is al-
ways wanting.

Differences in vocabulary Professor Postgate very wisely makes light of.
The test is of more than doubtful value.

3. The absence of two marked peculiarities of Tibullus, displaced que, and
mechanical repetition of words (except perhaps sanctae ²3 and sancta 15).

4. Numerous coincidences with Propertius and without the individual
touch of Tibullus.

5. The signatore (13). Τὴε obtrusion of the writer’s name is unlike
Tibullus. So far from this being a proof of his authorship‚ this is the sign
manual either of s deliberate forger or more likely of some person, presum-
ably a member of Messalla’s circle, who had no idea of addressing a public,
much less of mystifying it, when he wrote this literary exercise after the
manner of the great master.

6. The fact that the woman is not named. Defenders of Tibullian author·
ship explain by terming the poem ajuvenile productiori anterior to the affair
with Delia or Nemesis. But if the previous arguments are valid, the poem, if
by Tibullus, could not be a juvenile productiori.

One may well hesitate to disagrec with so eminent a scholar, one too so
thoroughly acquainted with this particular subject, and 1 venture to do so
with the greater regret because lack of space forces me to appear dogmatic.

1 may note first of all that the tone and the-language of this piece suggest
that it is sn epigram rather than an elegy, and that the association of it here
with 14 (which is unniistakably an epigram) is perhaps an indication that
the editor of this miscellaneous collection was quite aware of the fact. The
presence of the two pieces here also suggests, as all agree, that, whatever their
authorship‚ they were two stray poenis associated in some way with the Mes-
salla circle.

There are beautiful lines in this poem, lines,l may add, which appear to
have had a longer and more vivid tradition in English poetry than anything
else in the entire Corpus Tibullianum‚ but as Professor Postgate says, ‘one
swallow does not make a summer,’ and I cheerfully agree that the poem is
inferior to the elegies. Doubtless Tibullus himself thought so, otherwise be
would have published the piece. Inferiority‚ however, certainly the inferiority
