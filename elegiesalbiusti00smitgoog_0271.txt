A. A. 1, 659-663; 75-80= A. A. 1, 739-744. But although Ovid was
thoroughly familiar with Tib. the similarity here noted is probably due to the
common use of quasi-technical sources (artes amatoriae, treatises περὶ κολακείας,
etc. cp. 40 below and m). Tbese topics and their illustratione are all traditional
commonplaces which we find repeatedly in the comedy, epigram, Alex·
andrian literature, philosophy, rhetoric, etc.

fessional harangue might suggest the ‘lyric cry’ of one who like Pan had
more than once loved and lost, cp. 84 below and n. — fuge credere: the use
effuge or of some imperative of similar meaning with an infinitive as a polite
form of prohibition is a Latin idiom apparently not found in Greek. The
⁴ imperative regularly used in all styles is noli. suge for noli (for parce see 1, 6,
51 n., and for ntitte, omitte, Gild.-Lodge, 271, 2, n. 2) is strictly poetic and very
rare. Beside the passage before us Ι find only Lucret. r,1052; Hor. Od. 1,
9, ¹33 2,4‚ ²23 Statius, Theb. 9, 139. φεύγειν or φεύγειν μή with an infin.
is found for the most partin tragedy and elevated prose but is by no means
common. The development of an articulat infin. is scen eg. in Soph. 0. K.
1740. Other forms of fugio and fugito with an infin. are also occasional in
Latin, but only in the pocta (esp. Lucretius, Vergil, Ovid‚ Statius).

iusti: attracted to amoris but really belonging to causam, cp. Cicero, Phil. 2,

occasional even in prose, isacommon device of the poets. Abold use of it ·

is one of the difficulties of Propertius, and the epic poets of the first century
afford many exx. Tib. is neither as bold nor as lavish in this respect as his
contemporaries. Less than a score of exx. occur and most of them arc of
the ordinary type of 1, 7, 7, ‘victrices lauros '3 2, 1, 69,⁵indocto arcu,’ etc.
With our passage cp. esp. 1, 3, 6; 1, 4, 803 1, 5, 56; 1, 8, 183 4, 6, 1.
-amorisr ir. ‘of being loved.’ The passive use, as it were, is easily derived
from the context. Elsewhere, however, this is determined by an accompany·
ing genitive, subiective or objective as the sense demands.

two contrasted exx. in four lines. The first pleases by his management of a
