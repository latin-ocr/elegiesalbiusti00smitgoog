5ο. concelebra: an old word but in the sense oi ‘join in doing honour
to (a god)’ occurs here ior the first time (so Thes). The other exx. quoted
are Sil. Ital. 8, 2217 Auson. 317, 9; Paulin. Nol. carm. 27, 1383 Arnob. 5,
39; Ambros. Abr. 1, 5, 38.—funde: 1, 2, 3 and ι, 7, 3, with notes.

51. unguenta: cp. 2, 2, 7, etc.

52. collo: Schulze compares Hor. Sat. 2, 3, 256, ‘dicitur ex collo
furtim carpsisse coronas) See also Cicero, Verr. 5, 27, ‘coronam habe·
bat unam in capite, alteram in collo,' etc. The regular Greek word sor these
garlands worn on the neck, so that one might enjoy the perfume of the
flowers, was ὑποθυμίι, cp. Athen. 674 C.; Alkaios, 28 Crus.; Sappho, 43
Crus.; Anak. 38 Crus.

53. sic venias hodierne: in classical prose (cxx. in Cicero occur only in
the letters to Atticus) the optative subjunctive in the second pers. precis
used only of an imaginary ‘you’ The older language, however, uses this
construction when a definite person is addressed. It was therefore taken up
as here by the poets oi the Augustan Age. The remaining exx. in Tib. are

The vocative hodierne is used here aa a predicate instead ol the nominative.
‘The Greeks were cautious, and in Vergil the vocative can be detached and
felt as such’ (Gildersleeve, Persius, 1, 123 n.). Propert. 1, 7, 24, ‘ardoris
nostri magne poeta iaces'; 2,15,8; Ovid, Her. 10, 6; Met. 10, 1963 Verg.
A. 11, 856, ‘huc periture veni’; 2, 282; 9, 485; ιο, 327; 811; Statius,
Theb. 7, 7773 Hor. Sat. 2, 6, 2ο, Od. 1, 2, 37; [Seneca] Octav. 32; etc.
No other ex. is found in Tib. Some ol the Roman poets overdo it, cp. eg.
Pers. 3, 28, ‘stemmate quod Tusco ramum millesime ducis! Old Latin macte
virtute esto hasbeen cited as the analogy, cp. however such exx. as Theokrit
17, 66, ὄλβιε, κοῦρε, γένοιο, and Soph. Phil. 760, kb kb δύστηνε σύ, δύστηνε
δῆτα διὰ πόνων πάντων φανείς. .
