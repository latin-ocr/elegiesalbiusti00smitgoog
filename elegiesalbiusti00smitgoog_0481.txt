108. heuheu: 2, 3, zia-dedo malum: 1,4, 16n. Both τιθέναι and
διδόναι are used with κακόν, δλγεα, and the like, by Homer, but Thielmann
points out that with διδόναι the subiect is always a god, but that with τιθέναι
mortals and things aa wellas gods rnay be subject. Th. shows thatin latin
also the same distinction holds good for the popular phrase malum dare.

roo-112. The reference to Nemesis and to his own troubles to which the
poet has brought us so skilfully is a eoncession to the fact that he is a writer
- of amatory elegy. ι ‹

109-110. That love is a disease (cp. 4, 6, 18 and often), that it isa pleas-
ing pain, and therefore that the patient makes no ellort to recover, are all

Epist. 39, 6. ιΟ, out alasl' says Robert Jones (Musical Dream, 1609), ‘ 1
cannot long endure it, ) And yet, alas! 1 care not when 1 cure it.'

113-114. Transition to the concluding topic. A half playful reference to
the general opinion that poets, as well as prophete and lunatica, not to men·

116. oppida victa: one of the many references to the ‘floats’ (1, 7, 4 n.)
which were regularly carried in triumphs and which naturally added much to

primum de Gallia triumphurn trahens: hic erat Rhenus et Rhodanus et ex
