nores [aare

44. columna: might be taken as a case os singular sor plural (1, 1, 42 n.)
What the poet really sees, however, is a single grem monolith drawn through
the streete oi Rome by a thousand yoke of oxen, a pardouable exaggeration
in view of the sact that Hadrian himself, sor example, when he moved the
Colossus of Nero used 24 elephants, cp. Spart. ap. cit. 19, 12, ‘transtulit et
colossum stantem atque suspensum per Decrianum architectum de eo loco in
quo nunc templum urbis est, ingenti molimine, ita ut operi etiam elephantos
viginti quattuor exhiberet! This interpretation ot' our passage seems more
picturesque than to take columna as a collective singular and mille simply as
emphasizing the number of such loads.

For mille osan indefinitely large number cp. 1, 3, 5ο n, audior iugum =
‘yoke’ (to use our own country phrase) of cattle, cp. Ovid, Fasti, 1, 5643
Verg. A. 5, ¹473 Cicero, Verr. 2, 3, rao, etc.

45-46. The reference is to the piscinae or vivaria, the private ponds sor
salt-water fish made by shutting oli a portion of the sea by a wall or break-
water (males). Directions for their construction are given in the Geaponica,
ao, 1 f. The first and most famous one was built near Naples by Lucullus
(Varro, De Re Ruri. 3, 17, 93 Pliny, 9, 170, etc). Possible remains oi such '
piscinae (ag. the ‘Bagno della regina Giovanna’) among the ruins ol the
villa of ‘Vedio Pollione' (the local tradition oi the name) on the Punta di Sor-
rento are still to be seen. Stat. Silv. 2, 2, ·29, describing the villa oi Pollius
Felix (thevilla just mentionedl) at Sorrento, shows thatin his time such
piscinae were the ordinary thing in connection with any seashore villa. The
favourite diatribe on extravagance osten selects asan example this eminently
sensible and comparatively speaking inexpensive device, largely it would seem to
scote the rhetorical point that the solid earth is not enough for these builders,
they must needsencroach on the sea-whichisunnatural andthereiore impious
(1, 3, 37-40 n.). So here (45) the mole (built by the hand oi man merely
l'or fish) is said to ‘cage the tameless sea’; cp. Hor. Od. 2,18,19, ‘struis
domos Ι marisque Bais obstrepentis urges Ι submovere litora, Ι parum locuples
continente ripa’; Seneca, Tran. 3, 7; Hor. Od. 3,1,33 s.,etc.; Manil. 4,
2631 Cassiodor. Var. 9, 6, 4; Paulin. Nol. Carta. 24, 31; Seneca, Epist. 89,
21; Apoll. Sidon. Carm. 2, 573 Petron. 119, 88; Seneca, Thyrsi. 459; etc.

45. lentus: ‘unmoved,' ‘indifferenn’ ‘undisturbed' A purposely nalve
assumption that tish have a human sear oi the stormy sea. Another point
of view in the same connection is represented by Hor. Od. 3, 1, 33, ‘contracta
pisces aequora sentiunt Ι iactis in altum molibus’

46. neglegat: ‘disdain,' ‘care nothing for) The word harmonizes with
minas, which in itseli personiiies the blustering winter sea. An object clause
with neglego isnot frequent, but occurs in all styles.
