by the tribunes and passed in 367 nc. the number was increased to ten, five
patriciam and five plebeians (Livy, 6, 37, 12 f.). The increase to fifteen was
due to Sulla, and it is first mentioned by Cicero, Epist. 8, 4, 1 (51 B.C.). Caesar
raised the number to sixteen (Cassius Dio, 43, 51, 9) and in later times,
owing to the imperial privilege of electing supra numerum, the board, though 0
always known as the X Vviri sacris faciundis, often consisted of twenty or even
more (Cassius Dio, 51, 20, 3). Throughout tbe empire the XVviri were of
great importance, and appointments to the board were often given, as in the
case of Messalinus, to promising young men of good family. The Libri
Sibyllini were never seen except by the XVviri (Cicero, Div. 2, 112, etc.) and
their contents could not be divulged. The X Vviri had the sole right of ap·

proaching and examining the books, but they could exercise it only when so ¹
authorized by a special decree os the Senate (Cicero, Div. 2, 112, Dionys.

Hal. 4, 62, 5). Such a deorse, as stated above, was usually occasioned ι

by the occurrence of prodigies for which the ordinary methods of expiation
were felt to be insufficient or unsuitable (Livy, 22, 9, 8, etc). ln such cases
the X Vviri examined the Lz'bri Sibyllini and brought baclr a respomum, a
written report ostheir findings, upon which the Senate proceeded as it saw tit ‚
(Livy, 42, 2, 3, ete). ' .

The form of this elegy (which reflects the poet’s characteristic methods os
composition arid in spite of all argument to the contrary impresses me as a
. complete nnity just as it stands) is largely due to the influence of two con··
siderations-first, the fact tbat the poem is an elegy (hence, eg, the intro·
duction os the erotis clement, 105 i), second, the far more important fact that
the real subject of the poem is not the election of Messalinus to the XVviri
but the topics suggested by it.

These topics, which were all of national interest, are -first, the victory of
Augustus over Antony and Cleopatra at Actium. The father of Messalinus
commanded a division in that battle, and the victor was very properly regarded
as the saviour os his country (Hor. Od. 1, 313 ·Propert. 3, 11, 29). The
second is the prodigies indicating the wratb of the gods at the death of
Julius Caesar, a murder which, from the first, both for personal and political
reasons, Augustus made it his peculiar business to avenge. The third is the
legend of ,Aeneas and the destiny of Rome, the theme of the great national
epic which, though it is not mentioned, was being written at this time and is
evidently referred to.

The appointment of Messalinus naturally suggests Apollo, Actium, the
Sibyl. The Sibyl in turn brings up the prodigies for which her books were
consulted and the destiny of Rome which she foretold to Aeneas. The
vision of Rome in the days of primaeval simplicity is suddenly interrupted by
