’ 27. pubes: 1, 7, 5 n.—0sirirn: Osiris (Egyptian Usiri) was the brother and
husband of Isis. The conflict between him and Set is the eternal conflict
between light aud darkness, physical good and physical evil. Osiris is van·
quished, cut iu pieces, and thrown iu the water. But he is reassembled, and
finally revives under the care of his sisters Isis and Nephthys, the wife of Set.
His son Horus avenges him aud with the aid of Thotb vanquishes Set, but does
not destroy him. As the friend of mankind, he was the father of civilization,
of agriculture, of the vine, etc. (see below). But as the Greeks themselves
saw, the kinship with Demeter and Dionysos goes far deeper than that, and
they identified them at once. The worship of Osiris was more or less insep-
arable from that of Isis, and therefore spread enormously iu later times.
Moreover Osiris shares with Isis the tendency to absorb aud represent other
divinities. ¹

28. Theline, as Ernesti noted, isan echo of Kallimachos, ftag.·176, Schn.

’ εἰδυῖαν ψάλιον ταῦρον teneuram. As such (without including such turns as

· ‘subducere lectum' in 4, 13, 1, where see n.) it is practically the only known
echo in Tibullus of a definite passage. lf the Hellenistie poets could be
restored to us, we should doubtless be able to trace more, esp. in this elegy;
see Introd. p. 69. If this frag. of Kallimachos is from his Io, the juxtaposition
here of 23-24 suggests the possibility that he discussed the sarne question in
that poem.

The bull Apis (H ’api is also the Egyptian name of the Nile as a divinity)
is a suu god. Psammetichosl (663-610 nc.) built a magnificent temple for
him at Memphis (Herod. 2, 153, etc.) with spacious pleasure grounds, etc.
(Ail. H. A. ιι, 10, eta). Apis was the reincamation, the living emblem of
. Osiris upon earth, and at his death became Sarapis, ie. the dead Apis, who
has now become Osiris. The great extension of the worship of Sarapis dates
from the first Ptolemy, but rested on previous ideas. When an Apis died he
was buried with great pomp (Diod. 1, 84), and th'e whole country mourned for
him (plangere havera, etc). The priests, in particular, wandered about shriek·
ing and exhibiting every conventional sign of grief, while they sought a new
Apis which could be certainly identified bya number of welldefined marlrings
(specified byHerod. 3, 28; Strabo, 17, p. 807; Pliny, 8, 1845 Ail. H. Α. 11, 103
etc). During the theophania, the festival of five days which followed his
discovery, the new incarnation of Osiris was installed in his temple, and then
worshipped during his lifetime. For an account of the ceremonies attending
his installation, see ag. Herod. 3, 273 Diod. 1, 853 Ail. 11, 103 Ammian.
Marcell. 22, 143 etc. The Schol. on Juv. 8, 29 says that ‘populus Aegypti,
invento Osiri dicit: εὑρήκαμεν, συγχαίρομεν.’ Hence the point of Seneca's
words (Apocel. ¹3) describing how, when Claudius malres his-appearance in
