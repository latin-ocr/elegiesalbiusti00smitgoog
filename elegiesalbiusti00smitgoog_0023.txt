and art, with which we ourselves are not unlamiliar, had already
begun. ,

ln lact the Hellenistic period might perhaps be called the Age
oi Romanticism in Greek lise. At all events it is in some ways
the prototype and parallel oi our own Romantic movement which,
beginning with the nineteenth century, has profoundly modilied
the intellectual and social atmosphere oi to·day. Conventional
themes and methods os literary art give place to those which have
been overlooked, forgotten, or ignored in previous times. , There
is 'a notable tendency to deal with ordinary men rather than with
· distinguished persons, gods, and heroes, as in other days. The
shift os popular interest, by way os Euripides, from Die Let’den des

as it was os Goethe's time.

There was also a change in the point os view toward the literary
and artistic inheritance os the race. Then as now we are in an
age oi scholarship and os great libraries. Philology‚ philosophy,
natural seleuce, the spirit os scientific investigation in general,

and manner. As one might expect, the prevailing mood is the
sentimental and erotic, occasionally even the neurotic. But then ’
as now the idealist and the realist are side by side. Artistic
naturalism which, as in Herondas and in the 'comedy, deals with
ordinary and even with low lile as it was, is opposed by the mood
of gallantry and os sentimental eroticism which deals with high
lise as it never has been. On the other hand the protest against
over-refinement finds expression in a reversion to the popular,
antique, and primitive, in the use oi local legends and folklore, in
the deliberate archaism which prompted an author like Kallimachos
to revive in his Batlz os Pallas what appears to have been an
old Dorian function of the elegy long since sorgotten. But the
most characteristic literary evidence os this protest is furnished by
