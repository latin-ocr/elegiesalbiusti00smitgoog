INTRODUCTION

adorning the title page of Elizabethan books; occasionally too one
hears an echo os him in Speuser, and in certain lyric and dramatic
poets oi this period. But there is uo ‘Tudor translation’ of
Tibullus, no one piece of poetry inspired by him or showing a
deep and sympathetic study of his works.

Robert Herrick has been called the ‘English Tibullus! He
mentions Tibullus once,and has the same genuine love for the
country, buthe does not imitate him, and it would be difficult to
find two writers more unlike in their ideas of poetic art. Ίᾚε
inimitable Burton does not exclude Tibullus from his unique
library on the subjectos Melancholy, and traces oi the poet
may be detected here and there in Cowley, ‘Rowe, Walsh, and
other authors ; but as a whole references to him iu English of
the seveuteenth century are more rare and less striking than in
the previous age.

, The tradition oi him in vFrance ol the sixteeuth and seveuteenth
centuries is much the same. He is referred to by Rabelais and
quoted afew times by Montaigne. Echoes oi him are occa-
sional iu the poets, especially in such poets of the Pleiade as
Ronsard, Belleau, and Bais. Delia becomes, as iu 'England,
a literary reminiscence. In 1655 de Maroles published attans-
lation into French.

In Italy Tibullus was studied and admired from an early date.
Petrarch may have been acquainted with him, but the evidence
ior it noted in his Italian works does not seem conclusive. The
same is true of Boccaccio. Dante was too early to have known
him, except in the tenuous tradition of the Middle Ages. From
the middle however of the fifteenth century, echoes of him occur
with considerable frequency. Among others may be mentioned
Sannazaro's Arcadia, the Orlando Furioso of Ariosto, the Corte·
giano of Baldessar Castiglione, and the Aminta of Tasso. The
most striking example perhaps in the entire literature os Italy
is the Elegr'e of Luigi Alamanni, published in 1532. In his
dedicatory epistle the author speaks¹ os Tibullus and Propertius
