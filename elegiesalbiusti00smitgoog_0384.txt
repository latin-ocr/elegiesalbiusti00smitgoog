2, 5. Return to the original long vowel at the caesura is more common when
ct or aut follows, ie. words like ιι or aut serve to emphasize the pause.-
quis forsitan hostia: quis for aliquis after si, seu, ne, neu, nisi, etsi, is
common in all styles and periods (so Tib. except here). Otherwise quis sor
aliquis is found ior the most part with relatives (but this, too, is rare, only 8
times, egninthe orations ol Cicero). The remainingcases are usually in depend-
ent clauses with particles like quo (Cic. Vat. 373 Cluent. 144; 148), quod
(Verr. 5, 168), quamvis (Phil. 2, 44), ut (Acad. 1, 7), quotiescumque (Fin.
5, 29), cum (Proo. Com. 5), etc. In exx. lilre Hor. Sat. 1, 3, 63, ‘simplicior
quiseteat . . . “molestus’' . . . inquimus’3 Cicero, Paradox.44,‘filiarn quis
habet, pecunia est opus; duas maiore’; Terence, Eun. 252, ⁴ n'egat quis: nego;
ait: aio,’ the sentence is really conditional (ic. si quis negat, etc). quis lor
aliquis in principal sentences as here is occasional in the older authors (see
dicit), but otherwise it is very rare. ln the orations and the philosophical
writings ol Cicero we find only Fan. 3, 71, ‘alienumque a sapiente non modo
iniuriam cui facere verum etiam nocere,’ and Fin. 1, 5 3; Off. 3, 765 102; 110,
the phraseological quis dixerit. Still more rare is the Tibullian combination
here of quis with an appositive (hostis). Possibly the influence ol forsitan is
to he* considered (quis forsitan = τύχων τις), hence gerit indic. instead ol
subjunctive (cp. however Ovid, Rem. Amor. 419, ‘forsitan haec aliquis (nam
sunt quoque) parva vocabit.·)-torsitrn: Leo (Seneca, T rag. 1, p. 63)
notes the rarity of this word with the present indicative. Ovid, Amor. 1, 6,
45; Her· 2, 1033 20, 1363 Trist· ¹‚1‚69; 5210, 405 Pom· 4, 12273 4. 13·

tragedies, but not uncommoo in his prose, especially in his letters.

14. haecum: naon-nostro: ior nostro (lor meo) ascompared vvith habor
above cp. 1, 2, 11 n.- latete: a word of far wider application than the English
words ‘side’ or ‘flanlr ¹ by which it is generally translated. It is often used
of a mortal wound as here, cp. Ovid, Met. 9, 412, ‘ cognatumque latus Phegeius
hauserit ensis'; Seneca, Herc. Oet.1165; Eleg. in Maec. 3o; etc. In such
cases vve naturally think oi ⁸ heart’ or ‘vitals' rather than ‘flanln' Some·
times, esp. in Ovid, latus stands for virility or masculine vigour. In such
cases a favourite Elisabethan equivalent is ‘bach'

associated with primaeval simplicity, cp. 2⁰3 2, 5, 28 u.; Juvenal, 11,115; etc.
The preference sor thern and the continuation ol the type long alter the art
of the statuary was sully developed is an interesting illustration of Roman
conservatism.
