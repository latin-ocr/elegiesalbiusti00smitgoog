and metuo with this dative is fairly common, Plautus, Amphit. 1113; Verg.
G. 1,186; 2, 419; A. ro, 943 etc.

12. vota: 1, 5, 20 n.

23-24. 2, 2, 79-86; 1, 3, 5¹·523 2, 6, 17; 18 and notes.

13. quod: quod causat with the subjunctive occurs here and in 2, 3, 9,
otherwise (8 times) with the indicative.

15· deus non laedit amantes: 1, 2, 27—28; 2, 6, 32-54 and notes. For
another and a famous variation of the same idea, see 1, 4, 22 f. and notes.

26. The half smile of the poet is suggested by the conversational character
of the line, ag. the subject pronoun with the imperative (1, 1, 33 2.), 1120
abrupt, brief sentences, and esp. the use of salvus est with the dative of the
personal pronoun; cp. Plautus, T rin. 593, ‘siqnidem ager nobis salvos est ’5
Pseud. 1068, ‘minae viginti sanae et salvae sunt tihi'; Ter. Adel. 298; Heaut.
1603 Hec.643; etc.

aa. tristior: ‘cross,’ ‘in a bad humour,’ cp. Propert. 1, 6, 9, ‘illa minatur!
quae solet ingrato tristis amica viro' ; 1, 10, 22; Plaut. Casina, 230, ‘heia
mea Iuno, non decet esse te tam tristem tuo Iovi’; 2823 Afran. 120 R.,
‘mihi erit tristior'; etc.

' 17. te secum cogitat: ‘she only thinks you to herself,’ ‘every thought of
her mind is you! cogitare aliquem lays stress on the verb; cp. Pliny, Epist.
4, 2, 2, ‘Regulum cogita,’ ie. ‘imagine' ‘picture’ The construction is occa-
sional in Cicero and fairly frequent in Silver prose, bnt so many forms of this
verb involve a cretic that it isalways very rare in dactylic verse. cogitare secum
or cum animo and the like is antique for the most part and popular. The
example before us seems to be practically the only one in higher poetry, the
first in poetry of cogitare aliquem, and with the exception of Seneca Rhet.

ὓ Controv. 10, 2, 3, the only example in the literature of both constructione at the

same time-candida: ie. with no thought of guile, frankly.

18. The picture suggested is the reception room filled with lovers of Sul·
picia, who sit waiting to bear of her condition, each easily persuaded (credula)
that he is the favonred one. The best comment on credula is Ovid, Rem.
Amor. 685 (explaining why men find it so hard to retire from a love affair),
‘desinimus tarde quia nos speramus amari: Ι dum 'sibi quisque placet, credula
turbasumus!

19-20. Under the same circumstances Ovid says, Amor. 2, 13, 15, ‘huc
adhibe vultus et in nna parce duobus! Ι nam vitam dominae tu dabis, illa
mihi ’; cp. Propert. 2, 28, 42, ‘si non unius, quaeso, miserere duorum, Ι vivam
si vivit: si cadit illa cadam' ; Ovid, Her. 20, 233, ‘ iuncta salus nostrast: mise·
rere meique tuique, Ι quid dubitas unam ferre duobus opem'; Met. 3, 4733 11,
3883 etc.
