urbibus aut omnino in luce visus dirum ostentum est. privatorum domibus
insidentem plurium scio non luisse feralem. volat numquam quo libuit, sed
transversus aufertur) See also Ovid, Ibis, 2213 Propert. 2, 28, 38 ; Verg. A.
4, 462, etc.

'lhe most ominous variety 01 011, however, is, as here, the strix, or screech
owl (described by Ovid, Fast. 6, 131), because 101 the Romans the strix be-
louged quite as much to the kingdom 01 dreams as to the kingdom 01 birds
(see esp. Pliny, 11, 232, and Ovid, 11,). In the popular lancy 01 those days
witches could turn into striges (Ovid, Amor. 1, 8, 13; the famous story in
Apuleius, Met. 3, 21 11,), just aa, in the Middle Ages, they turned into cats, or
as the devil preferred the form 01 a black dog or 01 a vrolf. Hence one can
never be sure in any given instance whether the strix is a real strix or a
witeh in the 101111 010110 (Ovid, Fast. 6, 141, etc.). Indeed, striges = ‘witches‚'
not ‘screech owls,’ occurs as early as'Plautus‚ Pseud. 820 (cp. Propert. 4, 5, 17),
and the popular Latin 101111 strigae 01 Petron. 63 and 134 survives in the
modern Italian streghe. See also Mantuanus, Eclog. 4, 48, and 8,123, with
Mustard’s note. The object 01 the witches' transformation is always
vampirism iu some one 01 its various aspecta. The strix, therefore, and occa·
. sionally the bubo, is the Roman vampire (Pliny, 11, 232 ; Ovid, Fast. 6, 131;
Seren. Sammon. 1035; Plaut. Pseud. 820; Petron. 134, etc.). Any part 01 a
strix is valuable in a charrn (Propert. 3, ’6, 29 3 Ovid, Met. 7, 2693 Hor. Epod.
5, 20; Seneca, Med. 7333110), and the very tree in which she builds her nest
is accursed (011111121ον.1,12,2ο).-1101011101 suggests very well the cry ,
01 the bird, cp. eg. Seneca, Thyestes, 692, ‘letale carmen ore violento canit,’
and tbe Greek 1011111110 101 banning the vampire (Festus, 314: Carm. Pop.
29C1u8.), σφίγγ’ ἀποπομπεΐν νυκτιβὸαν, σφίγγ’ ἀπὸ λαῶν Ι ὄρνιν drurvyrtar,
ὠκυπόρους ἐπὶ νῆας.

53. herbasque sepulcris: to devour the growing plants is itself proverbial
01 extreme hunger (Verg. A. 7, 758; Lucan, 6, 109, etc), but to devour those
which grow in a graveyard invites the punishment ο1 sacrilege (Ovid, Fast.
4, 750, etc.). Moreover, such plants can avenge themselves, 101 they contain
magio properties and hence are used in charms the world over ; cp. Tbeokrit. 5,
121 (see Fritzsche‘s note); Propert. 4, 5, 11; Ηο1. Sat. 1, 8, 223 Epod. 17,
47, 010. See Riess in the Α. J. P. 24, 440, and Hartland’s Legend os Perseus,
vol. 1, pp. 151 and 165.

54. ossa relicta lupis: ix. in graveyards and lonely places, and possibly
remains 01 the unburied dead (Hor. Epoct. 5, 98, etc.). Here is where she
wanders, driven thither by the haunting ghosts 01 51. In antique folk-beliel'
no animal is so distinctly uncanny as the wolf. Nearly every part 01 him is
good in a chana (Ovid, Met. 7, 270; Lucan, 6, 6883 Hor. Sar. 1, 8, 423
