2, 1, 25] TIBVLLVS

casae here, ior example, are the umbracula os 2, 5, 97, the casae and tentoria
oi Ovid, hasti, 3, 523 i. quoted above, the casae oi the Pervig. Ven. 5, ‘cras
amorum copulatrix inter umbras arborum i implicat casas virentis de flagello
myrteo'; cp. 42, ‘iam tribus choros videres feriantis noctibus Ι congreges
inter catervas ire per saltus tuos Ι floreas inter coronas, myrteas inter casas.'

25-26. Meanwhile, ic. between 24 and 25, the lamb (15) is sacrificed, and
with ‘eventura precor,’ etc, the poet announces that the signs are all favour·
able.

25. viden ut significet: the form viden ut does not occur in Propertius
or Ovid (i). For the subjunctive significet, cp. e. g. Sil. Ital. 12, 713. Catul-
lus (61, 773 62, 8) and Vergil (A. 6, 779) use the indicative, and the indica-
tive aiter utin this construction is on the whole more common. Tib. always
uses the subjunctive, as here; cp.2,1,15; 1‚7‚17and 19; 1, 8,‘57; 2, 5, 72.

They were examined by the haruspices, who derived the attitude os the go'ds
on the given occasion from the shape of these parts, their size, position, etc.
The elaborate complication of the doctrine is in itseli an indication of
Etruscan influence. For religious purposes the exta were the liver, gall
sack, lunga, omentum, and aster the time oi Pyrrhus (Pliny, 11, 186) the
heart. In asacrifice like this, ia. a sacrificium consulmorium-‘in quo
voluntas dei per exta disquiritur’ (Trebatius ap. Macrob. 3, 5, 1) the gods
were asked whether the sacrifice was acceptable. The haruspices examined
the exta, and if they were normal answered in the affirmative. By far the
most important of the exta from this point os view was the livet, ale. by
eminence the nrintiafibra of 26; cp. 1, 8, 3; Propert. 4, 1, 104, ‘fibra locuta
deos,’ etc. It was divided into a pars familiaris and a pars inimica.
Unusual size oi the former portended good, 01 the latter, bad luclr (Cicero,
Diu. 2, 12, 28, eta). A fissura or division on either side was oi special
importance here (Cicero, Div. 2, 13, 32, etc), also the caput, or protuberance
00 the right lobe. Complete absence 01 it was a very bad sign, etc.; see
esp. the cxx. in Pliny, 11, 189 and 28, 11. If the examination oi the exta
(the technical word is litare) portended a favourable result, they were care-
fully prepared-again hy a complicated process—and then sacrificed to the
gods upon the altar. The viscera, i.e. the flesh oi the animal, was eaten; cp.
Serv. on Verg. Α. 6, 253.

27-34. 21-24 contained a general reference to rustic jollity. It was
artistically interrupted by 25-26, which opens the way ior the announcement
(27 1.) 01 the merry-malring on this particular occasion.
