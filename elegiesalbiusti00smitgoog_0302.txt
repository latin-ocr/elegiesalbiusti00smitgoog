NOTES [r, 5, 36

3²· detrahat arboribus: when personal interest is not involved Tib.
, alwaysuses the ablative with, or,as here, withoutapreposition, cp. 1. 66; 1,
10, 60; 1, 5, 323 otherwise always the dative, cp. 1, 9, 35 n.

33. tanturn: adjective—venerata: of a guest as here, Sil. Ital. 13, 704.
The participle is causal, cp. 2, 4, 47. Cf. u. on deveneranda, l. 14, above. -
virilm hunc: combines two exceptional freedoms of prosody. As a rule
both occur only before a caesura asin this example. Lengthening of a final
vowel in thesi irrespec'tive of position is occasional, more especially in the
epic hexameter, down to and including Vergil The same rule applies to
hiatus, of which Vergil furnishes the largest no. of exx. (40). But hiatus
with a syllable in m like this is excessivelyrare. This and two cases in
Propertius ( 2, 15, 1, ‘o me felicem! o uox mihi candidat et o tu’3 2, 32, 45,
‘haec eadem ante illam impune et Lesbia fecit ’) acc. to Mliller (De Re Met.
p. 376), complete the record for theelegy. So Ennius, Ann. 271, 5: Manil.
1, 795. Juv. 8, 241, and the pentameters of Catull. 66, 483 67, 44 and Mart.
3, 3, 4 are not entirely certain as to text. Other cases of arbitrary lengthening
of a final syllable in caesura are 1, 10, 13 and 2, 2, 5, where see the notes.

34. epulas: to be taken with both verbs. Theline adds the last touch
of rustic simplicity, cp. 1, 1,’7 n.; 1, 1, 29.

35-36. Express a popular Graeco-Roman proverb (¹ ventis loqui,’ etc.)
or which the elegiae poets, above all Ovid, show an especial fondness, cp. 1
4, 21, 4, 4, 73 3, 4, 9⁶3 3, 6, 27; 50. The winds are osten pictured as
carrying tbe words away to the seas, 1ο the clouds, or as here to'the ends
of the earth. Armenios for the more usual Assyrios (1, 3, 711.) apparently
because Armenia is itself high and windy. The touch of the oriental and
remote is given by odoratos (⁶ the place from whicb our perfumes come ').

35. Eurusque Notusque: a general term, ‘the wild wiuds.' No travellers
taking passage at Rome with either Eurus or Notus in its speci‘fic sense would
ever reach Armenia. The combination is Homeris, eg. Il 2,144, κύματα
μακρὰ θαλάσσης, Ι πόντου Ἰκαρίοιο, τὰ μέν τ’ Εὖρος re Νότος re Ι ὤρορ’ &ratker
πατρὸς Διὸς ἐκ νεφελάωνι 16, 765, cp. Verg. Α. 1, 85.

36. iacnt: the general rule that tbe common predicate of two or more
singular subjecta shall be in the plural is frequently neglected in poetry, esp¹
by Horace. The sarne rule is not infrequently neglected by our older English
writers, cp. ag. Machetlr, 2, 3, ‘Renown and grace is dead,’ etc. Tibullus
himself observes the rule but twice, 1, 10, 49, and 2, 4, 40. On the other ·
band, in two parallel exx., the one before us and 2, 5, 49, the rule of the
nearest was perhaps encouraged by tbe exigencies of metre. Otherwise he
follows the general rule of the singular with subjecta conceived of as acting
« individually. This is frequently illustrated, eg. in his favourite device of
