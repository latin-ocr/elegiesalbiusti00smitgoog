TIBVLLVS

Five of these elegies (r, 2, 3, 5, and 6) are addressed to agirl·
whom he calls Delia. Apuleius, writing about two centuries later
(Apol. ιο), tells us that her real name was Plania. The statement
was probably derived from Suetonius, and doubtless goes back
ultimately to the literary gossip of the later Augustan Age. There
is no good reason however for doubting it. Along with the
Cynthia (Hostia) of Propertius, the Lesbia (Clodia) of Catullus,

and others, it forms the foundation of Bentley's well-known but
not necessarily infallible rule that the real name and the pseudo-
nym should be metrical equivalents. A scholar quoted by Passow
suggested that Plania :Delia :: planus ιδῆλος. lt, will be obss
served how'ever that Delia, like Cynthia, is an epithet of Diana.
It seems more likely therefore that the choice of Delia by Tibul-
lus, like the choice of Cynthia by Propertius, indicates his belief
that the charms of his mistress suggest those of the beautiful sister
of the god of song.

The gens Plania would naturally be obscure. At all events it

· ι is not otherwise known, and 1, 6, 67-68 (where see note) can only

mean that Delia, though perhaps not a freedwoman, belonged de
iure to that class. Still more significant however is the actively
complaisant attitude of her mother with which the poet is so deeply
touched (1, 6, 57 ft). ·

It is safe to assume that this affair, like others of its kind, passed
- by the usual stages from ignition to refrigeration, but it would be
useless to seek for the details. The order of the Delia elegies is
not chronological. The poet himself deliberately warns us against

’ this assumption by interrupting the series with an elegy ona

totally different subject. In so doing he also calls attention to the
fact that, unlike Propertius for example, he never arranges elegies
in contrasted pairs nor does he group a number of them around a
single theme. On the contrary every elegy is complete in itself
and entirely independent of its fellows. It is clear that the Delia
elegies were never intended to tell a connected story, and they
cannot be induced to do so. The poet offers them merely as so
