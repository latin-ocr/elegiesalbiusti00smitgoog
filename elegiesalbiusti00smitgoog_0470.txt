NOTES [a. 5, 67

τὸ χρησμῳδεῖν γὰρ ἐκ σωφροσύνης προέρχεται· Plutarch, Mor. 435 D. For
the story of the Cumaean Sibyl in this connection, see Aristone, Mirab. 95 ;
Ovid, Met. 14, rao-153, and on the subject in general, E. Fehrle, ‘Die
Kultische Keuschheit im Altertum,' Religionrge'schichtliche Versuche und
Vorarber'ten, Bd. 6.

⁶5. ettesibi: et is not tobetakeu in the sense of‘and then! In point
of time ‘haec cecinit’ comes last. The Sibyl called the god and then, asin
all such cases, had to‘ go through the more or less agonizing process of
‘getting the spirit’ (66) before· prophesying at all. When the condition of
‘second sight' is once reached, the seer proceeds quietly to the end, cp.
Kassandra in Aisch. Agant. 1072 f.; Seneca, Agam. 710 f.; and esp. the
Vergiliau account of the Sibyl, A. 6, 45, ‘ventum erat ad limen cum virgo,
“poscere fata Ι tempus,'’ ait ‘⁸ deus, ecce, deus !” cui talia fanti'l ante fores
subito non voltus, non color unua] non comptae mansere comae: sed pectus
anhelum Ι et rabie fera corda tument: maiorque videri Ι nec mortale sonans,
adflata est numine quando Ι iam propiore dei.² The state continues during
the prayer of Aeneas (56-76) and even then (77), ‘at Phoebi nondum
patiens immanis in antro Ι bacchatur vates, magnum si pectore possit Ι excus-
sisse deumz tauto magis ille fatigat Ι os rabidum, fera corda domans tingitque
premendo! If Tibullus had mentioned these preliminaries in their regular
place, the artistic effect of the sudden interruption at line 39 would have been
lost. He therefore adds them here with the appearance as it were of au
afterthought.

66. A regular symptorn of the frenzy of inspiration. The sufferet tosses
her head so violently and rapidly that her hair flies in every direction, even
hanging down in front of her face as here, cp. Seneca, Oed. 2305 Ovid, Me't.
3, 726; Eurip. Iphrg. Aul. 757, etc.. Sometimes the expressive verb rotare
isused of the hair,cp. Lucan, 1, 566; Val. Flacc. 1, ²093 5, 170; Stat.
Theb. ιο, 17 33 Juv. 6, 3163 esp. Quintil. 11, 3, 71 (warning the young orator
against too much nodding), ‘iactare id et comas excutientem rotare fanaticum
est! rigunthe hair stands on end (as in extreme fright), cp. Seneca, Agam.
712, ete-caput ante: anastrophe of ante as of ad in 2, 1, 74, is found
only here iu Tibullus. ln prose anastrophe of ante is found only with the
relative (Schulze). ln Tibullus anastrophe is invariable with circum, praeter,
propter, and of course coram. Postposition of both preposition (per) and
attribute, 1, 4, 26. Separation of the preposition from its case beyond the
distance allowed ln prose is illustrated by ad, 1, 2, 32; circum, 1, 5, 51; con·
mr 1, ⁶9 30; post, ¹2 99 443 sine, 4¹ ¹42 3·

67-80. The conclusion of the Sibyl's vision in which she sees Rome mistress

of the world brings the poet back again to the present, and with it to the
