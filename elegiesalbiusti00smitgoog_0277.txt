exacts the penalty not being mentioned), cp. the amusing passage of Ovid,
Amor. 3, 3, 12. According to this conception perjury ‘ per crines Minervae'
would lqgically involve loss of hair to the periuret and at the same time the
integrity of Minerva’s own locks is at least formally assailed by periury in
their name. Hence the special force of this oath, ior Minerva was very proud
of her hair, as we learn, eg, from the story of Medusa, cp. Servius on Verg. A.
6, 289, etc. All agree that it was golden, cp. Pindar, Nem. 10,11; frag.

27. Tbe connection between the two statements is supplied by the axionr
that love belongs only to youth, cp. 1, 2, 89-96 n.; 33-34 below ; Anth. Lat.

all classical poetry. -aetasr ‘lile’ ‘lifetime,’ may be specifically old age or

exx. in two distichs (31-34) emphasizing the bitter contrast between youth ¹

and age, the last line (34) forming a transition to the final detail (35-38),
youth and beauty are irrevocable. Hence brielly -‘lose no time, youth will
pass (27) and so soon (28), and not only youth but the beauty that goes witb
it (29-30). Aye, and strength as well, ior theold there is no strength, no
beauty, no love (31-34). Once gone they are gone forever. Only gods are
always young, always beautiful (35-38).’ lmit. by Ovid, Ars Anvat. 3, 59-80,
cp. also Seneca, Phaedra, 761-776.
