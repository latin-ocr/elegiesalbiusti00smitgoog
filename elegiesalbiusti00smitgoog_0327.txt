θεὸν, Ι utrem νῦν eradicas πενιχροῖς πηνίσματα κρούει. Ι ὀψέ γ’ Ἀθηναίη Κύπριν
ἐλητσατο· Hor. Od. 3,15, 13, ete. Spinning is the conventional occupatiori
os poverty and os (voluntary or ensorced) chastity; cp. Anrh. Pal. 6, 284 aud
285, the err-votos oi Philainion and Nikarete, two young persons who have
deserted Athena sor Aphrodite. ¹Frequent also in the cumedy, Terence, And.

This passage which is a genre picture in the poet’s characteristic manner
(cp. 1, 2, 89-96; 1, 3, 83 f. ete.) and quite in harmony with the tradition oi
the idyllic-erotic type, is one of the many variations on ‘The Courtesan’s Old
Age,’ an unpleasant theme in which antiquity and, long afterwards, the writers
of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (cp. eg. du Bellay's Vicille Courtisane)
seem to have taken a special delight. Cp. eg. Propertius, 3, 25, whose direct
attack upon Cynthia is as characteristic ol„ him as is the indirect parable to
Delia oi Tibullus. Especially bitter is the attaclr ou Lais hythe comic poet
' Epikrates (Athen.570B.= Frag. Com. Graec. Adesg. 2, 282 K.). Itwasalsoa
conventional theme oi lyric and os epigram, cp. Hor. Od. 1, 25; 4, 135 Anu.
Pal. 5, ²13 ²71; ²735 2983 ete. The point oi view is always that of the
iuvenes iu 81-82. Bertin, Amours, 2, 7 is founded on this passage and 1, 8,
57-60.

many other exx. Ovid, Amor. 1, 2, 39; Verg. G. 1, 95 ; Sil. Ital. 1, 503 etc.
The tradition familiar to the tragedy and later art was inherited by the medi·
aeval Church, aud is suggested to us in the old woodcuts for sables.

85. haecaliis,ete.: 1, 2, 11; 1, 3, 823 4, 5,15-16and note. On this close
see Introd. p. 48, and cp. Beaumont and Fletcher, The Maid’s Tragedy, 3, x —

1 do hope we shall draw out
A long contented lise together here,
And die both, full of grey hairs, in one day.
