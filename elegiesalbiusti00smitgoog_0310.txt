60. Cp. the roguish imitation 01 Ovid, Rem. Amor. 462, ‘successore novo
vincitur omnis amor!

Giits are the specialty 01 the dives amator and the text oi Tibullus isoiten
preaebed upon in elegy, comedy‚ and epigram, 2, 4, 277 Ovid, Ars Amat.
2, 2757 Anth. Pal. 5, 297 307 317 217, etc„ etc.

The poet‘s statement is less insulting to Delia from the fact that it immedi-
ately suggests tbe common Graeco-Roman proverb that even the gods are to
be won by giits (Hesiod‚ frag. 272 1112011,ὀῶ70 θεοὺς πείθει, δῶρ’ αἰδοίους
βασιλῆας, cp. Diogen. 4, 21 and Leutsch's note in Paroem. Graeci, 1, p. 2357
Eurip. Med. 9647 Plato, Ray. 390 E; Menand. 537, 9 K.; ovid, Ars Amat.
3, 6517 Ρο11011. 1377 etc: osten in the negative form 01, ‘Deatb only loves not
gists,’ Aisch. frag. 161 N ; Eurip. Alkest. 9737 Hor. Od. 2, 18, 347 Epist. 2,
21797 etc.).

111-66. ‘The poor lover cannot vie with bis rich rival 1111110 matter oi giits,
but he will do much 101 you, that Dives, having bought you body and soui,
would never think oi doing.' Partially imitated by Ovid‚ Amor. 3, 11, 17.
An amusing commentary and variation upon it is Ars Amat. 2, 165, ‘pauperi-
bus vates ego sum, quia pauper amavi: Ι cum dare uon possem munera, verba
dabam. Ι pauper amet caute, timeat maledicere pauper, Ι multaque divitibus
non patienda ierat) 010.. cp. also Amor. 1, 10, 57.

62. in...nxm...1atere; asse. iastened to; emphatic 101 the more
usual ad latres or lateri with affigo, haereo, etc. So Cicero, Div. 1, 74, ‘arma
quae fixa in parietibus fuerant‚' and in the metaphorical use, Verg. A. 11,
507, ‘oculos'horrenda in virgine fixus’3 12, 70, ‘figitque in virgine vultus,' etc.

63-64. One 01 the ‘divitibus non patienda,’ and not at all the usual thing
in antiquity when dealing with the class 01 society to which these elegiae
heroines belonged. Ovid recommends his lover to show this attention in
Ars Amat. 2, 209, and in Amor. 3, 11, 17, aiter a quarrel with Corinna he
’ says, ‘quando ego non fixus lateri patienter adhaesi, Ι ipse tuus custos, ipse vir,
ipse eomes‚' cp. Horace's advice to tbe will bunter, Sat. 2, 5, 94 The point
is that such duties were the office 01 slaves.

ss-os. These are the dinners more 01 less sub rosa (occultos) 01 which we
hear so much in comedy and elegy, cp. Ovid‚ Amor. 1, 47 Ars Amat. 1, 229,
010. The women who attended such dinners bave always been about tbe
same, or at all events, the point 01 view with regard to them bas not varied
much. See eg. Demostb. ln Neaer. 1352; Hor. Od. 1, 27, 137 4117 ovid,
Amor. 2, 5, 147 etc.

65. occultos furtim: tautology acc. to Dissen who quotes 1, 6, 603 1, 8,
603 1, 1ο, 347 2, 1, 807 2, 6,117 457 010. But occultos 101011 to the point
01 view 01 the poet's gay but cautious young friends with regard to their
