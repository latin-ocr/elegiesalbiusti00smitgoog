or secondary influence oi ⁴the Hellenistic poets upon other literary
departments. From this point of view the Roman elegy de·
mands and repays constant comparison with the comedy and with
that belated echo of it, the rhetorical letter writers, Alkiphron and
Aristainetos. Another important source is the Greek Anthology‚
and still another, the Hellenistic works os art discovered in Pom·
peii, Herculaneum, and elsewhere, many of which lay emphasis
upon the sentimental, erotic, idyllic, or genre. We may also add
Lukian, Philostratos, Quintus Smyrnaeus, Nonnos, the Roman
epigrammatists, even the rhetorical and philosophical discussions.
In one way or another they all echo the once large and particularly
interesting literature os the Hellenistic period.

How much on the other hand the Roman elegy owes to the
Romans themselves it is no longer possible to say. It is sair to
assume however that the debt is considerable. The elegy was a
late comer, and at that time Roman literary genius had long been out
of leading strings. In this matter little can be learned from the
atmosphere of the elegy itseli. Developed and persected in the

thirty-odd years preceding the Christian Era, the Roman elegy oi
Gallus, Tibullus, Propertius, and Ovid was the productos an age
which in intellectual refinement and cultivation, even in the polit·

replica of the period in which the elegy os Philetas and his suc·
cessors had been produced. Ι
Indeed the ordinary Graeco-Roman liie os the Augustan Age

was much the same as that of the Alexandrian Age. So sar at
least as the elegy is concerned, the different classes oi society and
their relations to each other, the occupations and ambitions oi the
jeunesse doree, the entire mise-anselme of polite verse dealing with
contemporary existence harmoniae with the one almost as well as
with the other. Antique lise was very conservative, especially in
the conduct os a love affair ἁ la mode. The lover and his friends,
his mistress and her friends, his rival (always either a soldier os
