This poem is in honour of Sulpicia's birthday. It is the complement of the

preceding, and should be compared with it throughout. Again Cerinthus is
· represented by the sympathetic poet and friend.

ιΟ1ι, Juno Natalis, accept the incense offered thee by the fair hands of a
gifted girl. She has joyously arrayed herself for thee, that she may stand be-
fore thy altar to-day, the observed of all observers. She says 'tis all for thy
sake, this dressing in her best. Nevertheless, Goddess, there is also another
whom, in her heart, she would be very glad to sncceed in pleasing. Be
gracious, holy one, to this pair; let no one part them, and make them
love each other in equal measure. He only is worthy of her and she of him.
May her watchful dueuna never discover them, and Love furnish a thousand
ways of eluding detectionl Grant this, Ο Goddess, and corne hither in thy
festal attire. Her fond mother dictates the prayer she is to make, but the
girl knows her own mind, and in the stillness of her heart utters quite a
different one. She is sore sick with love, and would not be well if she could.
May she find favour in his eyes, and this day year may their old love be re
newed.' Imitated by Luigi Alamanni, in his elegy, Nalale di Cintia.

r. nantis Iuno: a woman's genius was known as her Jnno, aud she wor-
shipped her Juno in the same manner and on the same occasions that a man
worshipped his genius. For the feminine oath per Iunonem meam :the
masculine per Genium meum, see 4, 13, 15 n.

a. docta: connotes, in general, a person of literary training and ability; in
particular· esp. since Catullus’s time -a person who can write poetry. In
this more restricted sense it is an evident attempt to translate the Greek
σοφός as an epithet of poets (cp. Solon, 12, 52 Crus.; Bacchyl. frag. 9 Crus).
The poet is ‘wise,’ but his wisdom is the result of acquired skill as well as
native ability; it is ‘wisdom in the art of the theme, and in the art of the

treatment' (Gildersleeve, Introd. Pind. p. 36). So the doctus is the native r

genius thoroughly trained in the resources of his department ; in short heis
the literary artist in the highest sense of that word. Tibullus uses the
word of the Muses, 1,4, 613 cp. Lygd. 3, 4, 453 Catull. 65, 23 Propert. 1, 7,
rr; 2, 13, ης Ovid, Amor. 2, 4, 17; Ars Amat. 2, 281; Mart. 7, 69, ro, etc.
The Elizabethan translation of ‘ learned' is irnsirfficient.

4. conspicienda: 1, 2, 70 n.

5. relegat: ‘ascribes' So occasionally in this sense, but generally taking
ad or in with the aecus. of the person. lfind the dative only here. delegare
in this sense is not uncommon in prose, and always takes the dative.

6. placuisse: 1, r, 29-32 n.
