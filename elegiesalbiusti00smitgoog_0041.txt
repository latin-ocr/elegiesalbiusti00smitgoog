TIBVLLVS

tells ns that-‘sexto die magistratu se abdicavit, *incivilem potes·
tatem esse contestans! This view reflects his life-long attitude of
determined but loyal protest against the encroachments os imperial·
ism. Nor is it inconsistent with the lact that 24 years later (Sue-
ton. Aug. 58) it was be who proposed the title of Pater Patriae
for the Emperor. The ancient friend oi Brutus and Cassius saw
the inevitable trend os the system, but since Antony’s time he had
probably cherished no illusions, and he must perforce have admired
the personality and achievements os Augustus. In rr nc. the
Emperor created another important office, that of curator aquarum.
Again the first incumbent chosen was Messalla (Front. Ap. 99).
He died at v72 ol a lingering disease‚ which to judge from the de·
scription of it (Pliny, N. H. 7, 9o; Hier. Chron. ²⁰²7) must have
. been very like the modern paresis.

Messalla was also distinguished as an author. He was considered
the ioremost orator ol his generation (Cic. Ad Brut. r, 15, 13
Quint. ro, 1, 113), and he wrote¹ some memoirs ol his own time
occasionally quoted by later authors. Apassage in the Catalepton
(11, 13 ft.) has been taken as a proof that he also wrote bucolics
(cp. Pliny, Epist. 5, 3, 5). Is s0, the fact is ol peculiar interest
as suggesting one reason why Tibullus was encouraged to select a
type oi elegy so evidently affiliated with this department. .

But Messalla wisely chose to be a patron rather than a creator
ol literature. As early as the beginning of the imperial regime
his house on the Palatine had become the centre of a literary

circle which in importance was second only to that os Augustus ’

and Maecenas, and which appears to have continued even into
the next generation as an established tradition of the family.
This fact has an important bearing on our discussion ol the
Corpus Rbullr‘anum as it now stands.

. The relations between Messalla and Augustus were evidently

so cordial that it is only reasonable to suppose the literary friends ·

ol the one to have been largely the same as those of the other ;
buton this point no definite evidence is now available. Of
