NOTES [2, 5, 43

39. impiger: the epithet is descriptiva of Aeneas's whole life. So of
Hercules, Hor. Od. 4, 8, 30, ete-Aenea: for the form, cp. 1, 2, 52 n.
-trater Amoris: surely there was nevera greater difference between two
sons of the same mother. It is easy to see why the relationship isso rarely
emphasized by the poets (Verg. A. t, ⁶⁶7³ Ovid, Amor. 3, 9, 135 Her. 7, 315
Pont. 3, 3, 62) and also why it is less incongruens to call Cupid the brother

of Aeneas than Aeneas as here the brother of Cupid. Like Tibullus and
¹ Vergil, however, Guy de Tours, Souspirs‚ 2, 5, says—

Tu conseillois a ta germaine Elise
D'aymer le frere du petit Cupidon
Qui des fureurs du Dolope brendon
Dessus son dos seuva son pere Anchise, etc.

40· See 19 n.; Verg. Α. 2, 2933 rior. Od. 4, 4, 54; Ovid, Her. 7, 80; Met.
13, 6243 etc.

41-42. iamt note the frequent repetition of iam throughout this propheey.
The seeress calls attention to each picture as it pasees before her.

41. Laurentes agros: on the left bank of the Tiber where the T rojans first
landed and Aeneas (Verg. A. 7, 157, etc.) founded the town of Laurens Castrum ·
(49 below), cp. Livy, r, 1, 4, ‘Aeneam. . . ab Sicilia classe ad Laurentem
agrum tenuisse. Troia et huic loco nomen est ’ς Verg. A. 7, 63 3 Dionys. 1,
63.

μ’ hospita terre: referring to the treaty with Latinus, cp. Livy, 1, 1, 6;
etc.

Tbe Numicius or Numicus, once a large stream (Servius on Verg. A. 7,
150), now generally identified with a tiny rivulet known as the Rio Torto,
empties into thesea just south of Lavinium. It had an important religious
significance both for Lavinium and for all Latium. The water used in the

worship of Vesta at Lavinium was taken from it (Servius on Verg. A. 7, 150) .

and hence was in itself possessed of miraculous powers (44 n.). There was
an old sanctuary at tlre mouth of the stream still standing in Tibullus’s time
(Dionys. 1, 64) where the pontifices and the consuls performed a sacrifice
once a year (Scholia Veron. Verg. A. 1, 259). All authorities agree that the
deity worshipped here was a deus indiges (see below). As¹ the Trojan origin
of Lavinium was already accepted by Timaios the identification of Aeneas
with the old deus indiges of the Numicius must have begun as early as the third
century tac. So probably Ennius in his Annales (Servius on Verg. A. 6, 777)
and certainly Cato (234-149 ae), cp. Servius on Verg. A. 4, 620, ‘Cato dicit,
iuxta Laurolavinium cum Aeneae socii praedas agerent proelium commissum in
