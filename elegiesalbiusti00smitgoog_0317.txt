r,6, 22] TIBVLLVS

Haupt supported his theory of tum for tunc in this same way. Spealring
in general, an ounce of manuscript, even when that manuscript is no better
thau the Ambrosianus, is worth more than a hundredweight of conjecture, or
helfa ton of theory.

aa. The Bona Dea of Tibullus's time was apparently a combination of tbe
old ltalic Fauna aud Damia, a goddess of Magna Graecia whose worship was
brought to Rome probably not long after the fall of Tarentum in 272 ss„
Founder’s Day was May 1. lhe state sacrifice to her occurred early in Decem·
ber. Her temple was on the Aventius below the suum, the rock from
which Remus took his augury, hence her occasional title of Subsaxana. That
her sacra were ‘non adeunda viris’ is frequently mentioned. Regulations in
this respect were painfully, even ludicrously, strict. The profanation of her
mysteries by Clodius in Cicero’s time was a cause ce'lhbre. For the elegiae
poets and doubtless for the publicat large their reputation suffered from the
fact that the men knew nothing of them, aud also because they were reckoned
with the worship of Isis, etc., among the pretexts used by women of Delia's
stanrp to cloalr other designs. But with the decay of moral and religious feel-

. ing incident to the first century As). these mysteries must also have deterio-

rated. Even after all allowance hasbeen made for his customary exaggeratius,
especially in dealing with such a topic, we may fairly suspect that Juvenal’s
ravage arraignment in 6, 314 was not altogether unfounded.

²³· ad aras: Tibullus would naturally stop at the limits of the temple
inclosure, cp. Propert. 4, 9, 53, ‘parce oculis, hospes, lucoque abscede ve·
rendo: Ι cede agedum et tuta limina linque fuga. Ι interdicta viris metuenda
lege piatur Ι quae se summota vindicatura casa,’ etc. To go ad aras involved
sacrilege, hence the force of the following line.

24· Blindness was the traditional punishment for sacrilege iu the case of

this goddess, and in spite of the recent exploit of Clodius the statement is
solemnly repeated by Cicero, Dom. 105 and Harusp. 37. This ancient super·
stitiou, however,is hy no means confined to the Bona Dea. The blindness of
Tiresias wa's due to the fact that as a boy he had innocently seen Athena bathing,
cp. Kallimach. Hymn. 5, 78, and the imitation in Tennyson’s Tiresias, ‘adread·
ful light Ι Came from her golden hair, ber golden belm Ι And all her golden
armour on the grass, Ι And from her virgin breast, and virgin eyes Ι Remain-
ing fixed on mine, till mine grew darlr Ι Forever, and I heard a voice that
said Ι “ Hencefortb be blind, for thou hast seen too much, Ι And speak the
truth that no man may believe.”’ The idea underlying this and many similar
traditions is expressed in Kallimach. Lc. 99 f., οὔ γὰρ transpyrenaeum
ὄμματα παίδων Ι ἁρπάζειν · Κρόνιοι δ’ ὦδε λέγοντι νόμοι· Ι ds κέ τιν’ ἀθανάτων,
ὅκα μὴ θεὸς afrrds ἕληται, Ι ἀθρήσῃ, arod& τοῦτον ἰδεῖν μεγάλω.
