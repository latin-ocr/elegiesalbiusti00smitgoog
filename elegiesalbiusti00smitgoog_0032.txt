INTRODUCTION

are stoclr characters whether in comedy,'elegy, epigram, or actual

lise. They can be depended upon to appear in regular order, aud
after some experience the resulting situations, moods‚ 3ηά obser·
vations can usually be predicted in advance.

The bacillus amatorius generally penetrates the poet by way ol
his eyes, and the period of incubation is ridiculously short. Among
the first symptoms one of the most notable is an utter inability to
sleep. Itis useless to struggle. The arrows of Dan Cupid are
uuerring and burn to the bone. His victim is an ox at the plow,
and the worst is yet to come; he is a soldier detailed for special
service, always leading the forlom hope. To overcome the girl’s
disdain is only one of his troubles. Frequently there is 3 selfish
and tactless ‘husband' in the way. Then follow all the varieties,
moods, and motives os an intrigue.

The emotional temperature is far above the danger point.
Clothes torn, hair sorcibly removed, faces scratched‚ black and
blue spots—these are all marks os affection. As the observant
Parmeno remarks-

in amore haec omnia insunt vitia: iniuriae,
suspiciones, inimicitiae, indutiae,
bellum, pax rursum, etc.

‘A bitter·sweet passion at best,’ says Burton, aster consulting
all the books in and about Oxsord- ‘ dolentia delectabilis, hilare
tormentum— fair, foul, and sull of variation.

Jove’s book for recording lovers' oaths is running water. And
‘la donna e mobile ’—her promises are sport lor the winds and
scas. The poet is always poor. His mistress however is not
only a pearl, but a pearl os price. He promises her immortality
in his verses; she is more concerned about her immediate future
in this life. He learns as did the Abbe Voisenon that-

Sans depenser
C’est en vain qu’on esplre'
De s’avancer
Au pays de Cythere.
