NUPES [1, 9, ιο

Most frequently, however, the contrast is suggested by or used in connection
with the traditional discussion of the Ages of man. The theory-even in
Hesiod (cp. W. and D. 236), but esp. since Aratos (Phain. 108) —was that
husbandry was man's normal occupation, and hence that it was the only occupa·
tion during the Golden Age. Other occupations are abnormal and contrary
to nature, esp. navigation, the first and the worst of those inventione of human
greed through which the happy past was made to yield to the unhappy pres·
ent. For these and further details see 1, 3, 37 ff. and notes. On the grced
of gain, a favourite topic of philosophers and rhetoricians as well as poets, see 1,
ιο, 7-8 n. The standard example of it is the trader, cp. 1, 3, 39-40 n. ς and on
these typical occupations, esp. E. Norden, Jahrb. Phil. Suppl. 18 (1891),
p. 293 f., and Heinze, 'De Horatia Bionis Imitabore, Bonn, 1889, p. 17, ιι. 2.

In the present passage the farmer and the trader typify the contrast between
safe but grinding toil for a bare living and the pursuit of a possible fortune at
the imminent rislr of losing all. In this way a single statement tells us not
only that all men are greedy of gain (cp. note on lucra petens below) but also
that they are willing to endure anything to secure it. Thus the reader by the
time he reaches the case of Marathus is disposed to be as lenient as possible.

7-8. On the husbandman as an unremitting toiler, etc. cp. 2, 1, 5-63
Ovid, Amor. 1, 13, 15 (addressing Aurora), ‘prima bidente vides oneratos
arva colentes, Ι prima vocas tardos subiuga panda boves ’3 Verg. G. 2, 401-
402; Calvus, frag. 2M.‚ ‘durum rus fugis et laboriosum,' etc.

7. lucra petens: the anaphora, i.e. the introd. of the first example by
lucra peteras and the second by lucra petituras gives prominence to each
illustration and at the same time indicates thern as merely selected examples
of a totality.'

9. petituras: for the future part. as attrib. 1, 4, 443 r, ro, ¹43 2, 1, 61 ;
2, 3, 733 2, 5, 35³ 51.-freta per parentia ventis: (cp. Shalrespeare’s
‘always wind-obeying deep'— Cam. af Errars, 1, 1) emphasizes the peril
and uncertainty of the sea, instabiles rates, the ships ever pitehing and toss-
ing, as contrasted with the fixed, unmoving stars above by which they are
guided on their way. Note too that the active use here of certa, ie. ‘quae
certam viam monstrant,’ is also suggested, cp. Hor. Od. 2, 16, 3, ‘neque certa
fulgent Ι sidera nautis,' but Manilius, 1, 465, ‘contenta et stellis ostendere
sidera certis,’ where, as in 1, 479, ‘et certis quod legibus omnia parent,' certis
means ‘fixed' as here in Tibullus.

ro. instabiles: of ships as here, Ovid, Met. 2, 163, ‘utque labant curvae
iusto sine pondere naves Ι perque mare instabiles nimia levitate feruntur '5
Verg. G. 4, 195, ‘ut cumbae instabiles fluctu iactante,' etc, On dubiae in the
saum connection see 2, 3, 40 and note.
