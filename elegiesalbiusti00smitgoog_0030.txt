INTRODUCI'ION

a tendency to obscure allusion, a fondness for recondite words and
syntax, and other peculiarities often found in authors whose
learning overshadows their critical and creative faculty.

It will be observed that these vices are all formal and stylistic.

It may be added that the essential virtues of the type were in the
same sphere. The most striking aspect of this school of elegy
was its formal excellence. The genius of the great Alexandrian
poets was the genius of artistic form.

. quamvis ingenio non valet arte valet

is Ovid's shrewd comment upon Kallimachos‚ the representative
poet of the age. If therefore Kallimachos was looked upon as the
great exemplar and patron saint of the Roman elegy, the criticism
of him by Ovid can only imply that it was by reason of his formal
excellence. This conclusion in turn suggests that the debt of the
Roman elegy to its Alexandrian prototype, about which there has

been so much discussion, was 'largelya matter of form. lndeed
merely on general principles the conclusion seems inevitable that

the interest of any Roman poet in his Greek model should be first
and foremost in the technical sphere, to learu not what he had
written, but how he had written ; in short to discover and master
the secret of his art.

We have no reason to suppose that the Roman elegiae poets
were an exception to this rule, although the losses to the Alexan·
drian elegy have been so extensive that it is no longer possible to
follow out all the details. The Roman poets furnish examples of
most of the standard types developed by their predecessors. So,
too, many of their situations and motives‚ the commonplaces of the
department in general, are quite at horne in the Alexandrian
Age, even though it is not always possible actually to prove that
they were inherited from that period by way of the elegy. The·
same may be said of the literary references, of the favourite myths
and stories used for illustration, and of similar phenomena, espe-
cially in Ovid and Propertius

We often get at the situation indirectly through the immediate
