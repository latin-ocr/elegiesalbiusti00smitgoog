noras [a,4,16

35-60, etc), when gifts are the only attentioris that count (1, 5, 61-683 1, 8,
29; 1, 9, 5ι; 2, 3, 49; Propert. 4,- 5, 53; Ovid, Amdr. 1, 8, 57-68; 3,8;
Ars Amat. 2, ²733 3, 55¹³ etc).

13. prosunt: rie. to gain Nemesis, cp. 15-20, below.

14. cava manu: the beggar's gesture, cp. Sueton. Aug. 91; Vesp. 233
etc-pretium: as Mantinon truly observes, ‘est vif, mais cava manu est san·
glant.’ Of course; they are meant to be. And the sudden appearance of
, similar language to Delia in 1, 5, 68 f. (where see n.) was au indication that
in the poet’s opinion the mistress he had once idealized had fallen to the
level of Nemesis aud her kind, ia. of the rapax meretrix, who like other
stoclr characters of the elegyis equally prominent in the allied departments

. of comedy and its echo, the rhetorical letter writers, the satire, the epigram,

and even the Horatian lyric. The type of Nemesis seems not unlike that of
Philumena for example (Alkiphron, 1, 40), who writes to her lover as follows,
-‘Why do you make yourself miserable with all these letters of yours? Ι
don't want,letters; 1 want fisty gold-pleces. If you love me, give them, if you
are stingy, stop bothering me. Good-bye.’ Similardescriptive passages re-
ferring to this type are eg. Menander, 537 K.; Plautus, Asin. 165-242; Truc.
23-94; Trabea, p. 36 R.; Alkiphron, 1, 35 and 363 Aristainet. 1, 143
Philost. Epist. 19 and 23; Hor. Epist. 1, 17, 553 Anah. Pal. 5, 29-343 1133
217³ Mart. 11, 5ο; 12, ⁶5³ Petron. 137, etc.

The sphere of pretium aa aword to describe· the poet's view of the situa-
tion is seen eg. in Ovid, Amor. 1, 10, 63, also to a mistress, ‘nec dare, sed pre-
tium posci dedignor et odi ’; cp, iu lighter vein, Ars Amat. 3, 551, ‘a doctis
pretium scelus est sperare poetis. 1 me miserum, scelus hoc nulla puella timet,’
and esp. 2, 275-280 (offen imitated by the Elirabethan poets). Naturally the
lena does not mince matters, cp. eg. Propert. 4, 5, 533 Ovid, Amor. 1, 8, 57-68.

Nemethy quotes as perhaps the suggestion of this line Anth. Pal. 12, 212,
3, τὴν χέρα μοι κοίλην προσενήνοχας· ὡς ἀπόλωλα. Ι μισθὸν ἴσως αἰτεῖς.

15-20. Note that this paragraph begins and ends with practically the same
line. This striking rhetorical device isan extension of that already observed
in 1, 4, 61-62, where see note. Note too the arrangement of topica within
the paragraph itself, rie. 15, the reference to the Muses, followed (16-18) by
a negative, what he does not care for; then reversing the order and contrast-
ing the positive, what he does care for (19), followed hythe repeated refer-
ence to the Muses.

1631st sint canenda: ate. not ‘to write epic,’ which would be ut bella
canantur, but the passive periphrastic, ‘with the idea that l am to write epic,’
‘that epic must be my theme! The construction is not common in a clause
of this type-bella canenda: f.e. epic, cp.Verg.A. 1, 1, ⁴ arma virumque cano ’ς
