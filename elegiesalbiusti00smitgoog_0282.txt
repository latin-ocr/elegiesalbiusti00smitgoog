NorES [1, 4, 43

the attendant (and aggravating) circumstances, the contrast is between 42
and 43-44, quamvis in 43 corresponds to a quamvis to be supplied after etin
42, and et :fevenss ‘If he wishes to take a long walle, don’t fail to go with
him -even though it be hot and dry, even though it threaten rain,’ etc.

41. neu: ‘and do not! Corresponds to cedas, above—comes ire: r'.e.
comitari. This use of ire with some noun to represent the vcrbal idea sug·

Ἴ gested by the noun runs through the language.

4²· Cp. r, 1, 27 n. Ovid, Ars Amat. 2, 23ι, ‘nec grave te tempus
sitiensque Canicula tardet Ι nec via per iactas candida facta nives) ’

43. ferrugine: a colour word which in both its literal and metaph. uses
isa close parallel of purpureus end caeruleus ¹and is osten coupled with
them, esp. with the latter. ‘The various uses of ferrugineas, ferrugineus, and
ferrugo being compared,’ says Munro on Lucret. 4, 76, ‘the colour denoted
would seem to be a darlr violet lilre that of steel aller it has been heated in
the tire and cooled: Plautus, Miles Glor. 1178, ‘⁴ palliolum habeas ferrugineum,
nam is colos thalassicust”; answering therefore to Homer's πορφύρεος or οἰνοψ
applied to the sea5 asin certain weathers the Mediterranean has precisely
such a colour! So too the word is used of Charon’s boat (Verg. Α. 6, 303),
of the garments of Pluto (Claud. De Rape. Pron, 275) suggesting the
darkness of Hades, of the sun in eclipse (Verg. G. 1, 467, eto), but never for
a storm es here. purpureus, however, is often so used and what has been
said shows that ferrugo is eminently suitable for that startling blaclrness of a
summer tempest driven on by a high wind such as Eurus. picea (an emen-
dation of the Itali) is frequently applied to storm clouds but is not found else-
where with ferrugo (cp. however, ‘ferrugine atra,’ Ovid, Met. 15, 789).
Translate then ‘praetexens’ etc, ‘shrouding the sky with purple gloom.'

It should be noted that the Ambrosianus here reads, ⁴ quamvis praetexens
pieta ferrugine eaelum Ι venturam amiciet imbrifer arcus aquam! The text
is corrupt (certainly, eg. amiciat and imbrifer) but I am not so certain that
arcus should be removed. The antique folklore of the rainbow is a corn·
plete contrast to ours. For us, as for the Hehrews, it is the illuminated text
of God’s own covenant written on the skics (cp. Gen. 9, 12-17), the bow of
promise, the herald of fair weather, heaven smiling as it were through her
tears. Not so the Greeks and Romans. For them the rainbow was a por·
tent (Homer, II. 17, 5473 Ovid, Met. 1, 270), the herald of storm and dis·
aster (Empedolrles, 50, Diels; Anaxag. in Schol. Iliaci, l.c.,· Aratos, 9403
Aetius, Dox. Gr. Diels, 3713 Plaut. Cure. 131 a, ie. as we say, 'the sun is
drawing water’3 Verg. G. r, 33¹3 Ovid, Met. 1, ²70³ Propert. 3, 5, 323
