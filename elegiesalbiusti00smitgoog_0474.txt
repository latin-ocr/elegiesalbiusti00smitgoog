concord of audita (sc. esse) with arma and tubas, 1, 5, 36 and notes. On
the omission of esse, 1, 3, 43 n.

74 That is, the voices of the gods in their sacred groves foretold defeat to
Roman arms. So in this connection, Verg. G. 1, 47t'›; Ovid, Met. 15, 792;
Obsequens‚ 69, ⁶ oraculo Apollinis vox audita, “ lupis rabies hieme, aestate fru-
mentum non demessum.”’ Also after Pharsalia, Petron. 122,179; Lucan, 1, 570.

75-76. Note that by dropping the cons. with serunt for the moment this
most frightful of all the portenta following the death of Caesar is, as it were,
set off by itself and thus made more prominent. References to this portent
are numerous, cp. Pliny, 2, 98, ‘fiunt prodigiosi et longiores solis defectuus,
qualis occiso dictatore Caesare et Antoniano bello totius paene anni pallore
continuo.’ Plutarch, Caes. 68, also says that the sun was pale and ghastly
for the entire year and gave out so little light and heat that the crops did not
ripen at all. Obsequens‚ 68, ‘soles tres fulserunt circaque solem imum corona
spiceae similis in orbem emicuit, et postea in unum circulum sole redacto ’
multis mensibus languida lux fuit' (this Livian account reappears in Cassius
Dio, 45, 17, 5, and in an abbreviated form in Appian, B. C. 4, 4, 14). See
also Ovid, Met. 15, 7853 Verg. G. 1, 466, where Servius says that a total
eclipse of the sun lasting from the sixth hour until night, toolr place on the
Ides of May following Caesar's murder. ,

tue cause of this phenomenon, and probably of the showers of stones and
of the noise of battle 111 the skies, was doubtless a terrific eruption of Aetna
just before Caesar’s assassination, cp. Verg. G. 1, 472, where Servius quotes
from Livy, ‘tanta flamma ante mortem Caesaris ex Aetna monte defluxit ut
nou tantum vicinae urbes sedetiam Regina civitas afflareture It is well
lrnown that the great volcanic disturbances in the Pacific in 1883 upset the
normal condition of the atmosphere throughout practically the entire world.
In the United States, at least, the appearance of the sun that year, esp. during
August and September, was the same as that recorded for the summer of
44 116. So, too, during the entire summer of 1906, after the great eruption of
Vesuvius, the Italian sun was noticeably dimmer than usual.

77-78. Returns (fudisse, etc.) to the cons. with ferunt (Schulze). De·
pendence, however, on vidit seems to offer no difficulty.

77. Aportent frequently mentioned and always carefully recorded by the ·

priests, Apollon. Rhod. 4, 1284; Verg. A. 2, 1733 Cicero, Div. 1, 743 98;
99; Livy, 43, 13, 43 Augustin. C. D. 3, 11; etc. ln this connection, Verg. G.
