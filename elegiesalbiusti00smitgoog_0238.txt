the goldeu days of good King Saturu! Then there was uo scafaring and no
war, but continual ease and abundance, idyllie innocence and perfect peace.
In these days of Jove we have war and carnage and bloodshed without end,
the sea, and a thousand other short cuts to an untimely grave. Spare me,
lathem 1 have done the gods¹ no injury in word or deed. But if it so be that .
my time has come, place a stone at my grave, and let it record that Tibullus
died while following Messalla over laud and sea.

‘And when I am dead Venus herself will lead me to the Elysian Fields„
In that paradise of eternal joy dwell the s'ouls of all those who, lilre myself,
have been faithful lovers in life and willing servants of the goddess. Deep
down in the nethermost gloom lies the abode of the wicked, and black and
thunderous rivers encircle it. There Tisiphone forever drives before her a
throng of sinuers, scuttling this way and that before her cruel scourge, and
the monster watching at the gate never sleeps. There are found Ixion, and
Tantalos, and Tityos, aud the daughters of Danaos, traitors to love—may
they be joined by those who wrong me iu my love and pray for my long

¹absence!

‘I beseech you, Delia, be true, and remain modestly at home. Let me
appear unexpected and unanuounced as though 1 had dropped from heaven.
Ruu then to my arms just as you are, with bare feet and your hair all un·
bound. That is my prayer, and may Lucifer, son of the morning, bring that
joyous day to mel' Ι

r. ibitis, Messalla: plural of the party (ae. ‘ipse cohorsque ’), singular
of the most uotahle person init (Messalla), cp. Vergil, A. 9, 525, ‘v0s, o
Calliope, precor, adspirate canenti’ ; Homer, Odyss. 2, 310, and often.

,2. outinam: occurs here (acc. to Blase) for the first time, cp. Ovid‚ Met.
1, 363 ; Val. Flaccus, 1, 1133 7, 135 ; 8, 439. osi is more common, but does
not begin until Verg. Α. 11, 415. si alone,as eg. in Petron. 8, 'si scires
quae mihi acciderunt‚' is very rare, and the use of this optative subjunc-
tive with uo particle at all seems to be found only in Catull. 2, 9, 'tecum
ludere possem,’ and Ovid‚ Her. 8, 34, ‘posset avus! uanam alone, as
in 2, 2, 17, and ’6, 15, is common in all styles aud periods. For omission
of the verb as here (occasional in Cicero, cp. Ter. Adel. 518 ; Stat. Silo. 4, 6,
173 Tac. Ann. 1, 58; etc.) see 43 n., and for atque utinam, 4, 13,5 n.—
memores :·the plural is afterward particularized and explained by ipse
cohorsque, cp. r, 5, 36 u. —cohors ι ia. the cohors praetorio, the group of
friends, generally young men of distinguished family, taken along hythe
proconsul or propraetor when he went to his province, or by the general on
his campaign. The practice of inviting poets and other literary men dates
from Ennius, who accompauied Fulvius Nobilior ou his campaign against
