primaeval times when luxury was unknown. Would 1 were living in those
times. 1 would not now be going to war, and, who knows, perhaps to my
death. Protect and preserve me, Lares, even as when l was a little boy and

let others win fame on the bloody field. To hear them rehearse their deeds

violence. At best he comes upon us all too soon, and then the barren world

Cp. Cowley’s Sylva, Ode 5, ‘Curst be that wretch (Death’s factor sure) who

silver hair, Ι Frequent before, grew rare,’ etc.

1. protulit: so Propert. 2; 6, 31, Hor. A..P. 58 and 130, and often.

a. ferus et ferreus: this alliterative quasi-punning phrase finds its
prototype aa early as Ennius, Anu. 183-184 V, ‘feroque Ι ornatur ferro,' cp.
Cicero, Quint. Frat. 1, 3, 3, ‘quem ego ferus ac ferreus e complexu dimisi

isa Sabine word (Servius on Verg. A. 3, 235) applied to prodigies (Festus,
