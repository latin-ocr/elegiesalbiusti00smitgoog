This elegy belongs in the group concerned with Marathus. See Introd. p.
51. The scene here as in the fourth is very dramatic; in lact, nowhere are
the maniiold relations between the elegy and the comedy more clearly dis·
played than in this particular type which with its blending oi sentiment and
satire, and with its somewhat nearer approach to the language oi everyday
iiie reflecte the mood oi the Hellenistic epigram.

Tibullus finds his boy Marathus and the girl Pholoe together, and having
already noted certain whisperings, becks, and smiles, ranges the two before
him and comes to the root os the matter at once.

1-26. ⁶ 1 am no inspired reader oi signs and omens, Marathus, but Ι have
had a thorough course in the finishing school oi Darne Venus and 1 cannot be
deceived asto the meaning oi your symptoms. Don't try to hide it from me
- you will find it a relies to give up struggling. All this care and pains which
you have been expending on your hair, your nails, your clothes, your tight
shoes, and what not, are oi no help to you. The girl there can neglect
everything oi the sort, and win you just the same. Can it be that some one
has cast a spell on you? 'lhose old witches can do marvellous things. But
why in your case do Itallr of spells? Beauty does not require the aid oispells.’

27-66. ‘As ior you, Pholoe, bear in mind not to coquet with the boy;
Venus punishes such conduct. Also don't asli ior presents. Get them from
your gray-headed lover—it is his duty. A lover that is young and strong
and handsome is more to be prized than gold. Jewels and precious stones
are cold comfort when a woman is old and lonely and no man makes love to
her. 'Tis too late to call back youth and love when hoary eid has settled
upon us. Then is when we study to be beautiful; then is when we
hide our years with dyes, pull out the white hairs, get ourselves new skins.
Enjoy your youth while you still have it. It will be gone anon. And don't
torment Marathus. Where is the glory in conquering a mere boy? Ii you
