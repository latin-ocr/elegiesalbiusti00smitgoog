Ι INTRODUCI'ION

actual foundation os them was the series next to be considered,
and possibly some laets lu addition os which the writer had
persona] knowledge. Is so, not the least interesting feature ol
this collection is the unique opportunity it offers to study the
methods pursued by an antique elegiae poet iu the artistic use
of his material. It would also be interesting if we could name
the author. It is most natural—indeed on the whole it is ,
most logical—to suppose that his name vas Tibullus.¹ The
poems emanate from Messalla's circle, and are in no respect
unworthy os Tibullus. A detailed technical and stylistic com·
parison with the lirst two books reveals differences, but none Ι
ol sufficient importance to preclude the possibility ola common γ
authorship. On the other hand among the many resemblances
that might be cited not the least striking is the characteristic
objective attitude os our poet as compared with that os Tibullus
himself in 2, 2. Messalla’s circle was to say the least ex·
ceptionally favoured, if it 'possessed a second elegiae poet so like
Tibullus in his poetical temperament and so nearly his equal in
genius. Tibullian authorship ol these poems however is only a
matter of probabilities. It can neither be proved nor disproved.

The authorship os the second group is beyond question. It-
consists os six short· poems composed by Sulpicia herself, the
more interesting because they were apparently not written sor the
purpose of telling her story alter the artistic sashion ol the elegy.
On the contrary with the possible exception os the first (4, 7),
which reads like an entry in her diary, these pieces are in the
form os briei notes addressed to Cerinthus himself, and it seems
evident that none ol thern was ever intended sor publication.

No one can read these verses without being impressed with
the remarkable ability ol their author. She certainly does not
rank among the great poets os the world, even her mastery of
technique occasionally suggests* an amateur3 and aster her mar·

¹Reitzenstein‚ P· W. 6, p. 93. Biirger. Hermes, 4ο, 328, finds them echoing
the last book ol Propertius, therefore not Tibullian. The argument isos no value.
