INTRODUCTION

tongue was not always attuned to such a strain, are in themselves
an indication that the death of Tibullus like that ol Vergil, was
felt by the world at large almost as a personal bereavement.
So the loss to letters ol Tibullus the poet made a similar impres·
sion upon all cultivated men. This is really the message of Ovid’s
famous elegy upon his death. Elsewhere too this generous and
discriminating critic does ample justice to the genius ol his great
predecessor.

Velleius Paterculus‚ writing in the time of Tiberius, brackets.

Tibullus with Ovid as fperfectissimi in forma operis sui' It is ἦ v
quite possible os course that the honest old campaigner had never '.
read Tibullus. The criticism however is doubtless an echo of the ἶ
prevailing opinion. Most valuable ol all is the criticism of Quintilian ’ ν
(see p. 179), written in the last decade ol the first century. For y
him Tibullus isos the lonr great elegiae poets the most consum-
mate artist. Nor is Quintilian his only admirer in this period.
We learn sor example that at that time a copy ol Tibullus was
considered a suitable present (apophoretum) for a guest at a
dinner party (Martial, 14, 193)-a sure sign that our poet was
looked upon as a standard author.

It is evident too that he was read as well as admired. The
allusions to him in Statius and Martial (see pp. 179-180) presup-
pose a reading publicthoroughly familiar with his poetry. Literary
reminiscences ol his phrases suggest a similar assumption. From
this point os view the largest debtor to our poet is Ovid, who
is continually paying him the sincere tribute of imitation. Until
the age os the Antonines however, more especially perhaps in
Martial and Calpurnius, echoes os the Tibullian phrase, though
generally slight and often indefinite, are sufficiently frequent and
varied to imply in themselves a living tradition of the author.
Perhaps the best proof ol Tibullus’s real popularity among a wide
range oi readers is the lact that echoes ol him are not infrequently
heard in the ordinary metrical epitaphs os the imperial period.

strange-to say however, il we exclude the lew examples found
