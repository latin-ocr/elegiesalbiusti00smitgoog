rempublicam, potestatem, niagistratum, eto-regno regna: ‘lord it in your
domain! For the immediate repetition oi the substantive see 4, 7, ιο ιι.
Observe however that here the substantive is repeated in another sense, ie.
regnum = ‘kingdom' (a common use in the erotic sphere‚ cp. 2, 3, 593 4,
5, 4 n.) and regna, the poetic plural here = ‘rule,’ ‘sovereignty' (Propert 4,
7, 503 4, 10,18; Ovid, Rem. Amor. 153 etc). This is an artistic but un· ·

83-84. The votive inscription, like the epitaph (cp. 1, 3, 55-56 n.), is a
regular motive ol the elegy. So cg. Propertius 2, 14, 27, ‘has pono ante tuas

See Introd. p. 35. The poet has been called to military service. As aeon-
trast between war and carnage, as opposed to peace and the quiet country
lile, this poem has much in common with the first and third of this book.

that no love affair is mentioned has led to the conclusion that it was prior to
the ailair with Delia, ii not to the composition oi the group to Marathus.
