NOTES [2, 3, 14r

12. cithara: Apollo is the divine rnusician, cp. 2, 5, 2-10 n. -intonsre
comae: the chief glory of Apollo's immortal youth and beauty is constantly
referred to, cp. 1, 4, 37-38 n. The frequency of this particular reference in
Tibullus himself is esp. noticeable.—profuiruntz rie. to win Admetos, cp. 1,
8, 93 2, 4, ι5; etc. For the prosody cp. 4, 5, 4. irunt for irunt in the
perf. indic. act, as here, ‘though it is in the classical and later period more
prominent in Dactylic Poetry than in other verse, owing to its suitableness
for the dactylic metre, is not by any means unknown in the older (and later)
dramatists. . .. Plautus appears, however, to use it only at the end of a
line or hemistich, so must have regarded its use as alicenee to be resorted
to under metrical necessity. It does not appear to have been used in
Tragedy, nor by the earlier Epic writers like Ennius, and not very frequently
by Lucretius (cp. Munro on 1, 406), which points to its having been a pro·
nunciation of. colloquial Latin that won its way only gradually into the higher
literature’ (Lindsay, Latin Language, p. 532).-ve: for the position, 1,1,

4073-14 Thus Apollo, the divine healer (4, 4, 1 f), becomes in himself a

striking illustration of theold maxim that Love will not yield to physic;
cp. Theokrit. 11, 1, Οὐδὲν πὸτ’ τὸν ἔρωτα πεφύκει φάρμακον ἄλλο, l Ν iria, οὔτ’
ἔγχριστον, ἐμὶν δοκεῖ, οὔτ’ ἐπίπαστον, l ἧταὶ Πιερίδες. Philetas, the old shep-
herd in Longus, 2, 7, 7, also represents the traditional atmosphere of the
bucolic. He sums up a lifetime of experience with, Ἐρωτος γὰρ οὐδὲν pappa·
κον, οὐ πινόμενον, οὐκ ἐσθιόμενον, οὐκ ἐν ᾠδαῖς λαλούμενον, tn μὴ φίλημα καὶ
περιβολὴ καὶ συγκατακλιθῆναι γυμνοῖς σώμασι. Ovid, Her. 5, 149, has ‘me
miseram, quod amor non est medicabilis herbis'; Met. 1, 523, ‘ei mihi quod
nullis amor est sanabilis herbis,’ etc. See also 1, 5, 43-44 n.; 1, 2, 59—62n.
Theokritos’s prescription of the Muses and Philetas's homoeopathy have both

been the theme of many epigrama, ancient and modern. cp. the echo of
Tibullus in Carducci (l.c., 11-32 n.) -

Ne basto l'arte medica
Verso la cura nova:

Ahi, sol di furie e lacrime
Il nostro iddio si giova.

14. quidquid artis: for this emphatic expression of totality, see 1, 1, 51 n.

142-16. The remains of a passage on the making of cheese as first taught
by Apollo himself at this time. It was, doubtless, brought in here to ern-
phasize the ancient conception of Apollo the divine Herdsman as seen, for
example, in the Homerie hymn to Hermes.

For a detailed account of the antique methods of making cheese, see esp.
Columella, 7, 8, 1f.
