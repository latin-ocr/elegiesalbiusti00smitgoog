is seen, ag, in Petronius, 37, ‘mero meridie si dixerit illi tenebras esse,
credet’; Titinius, 100 R, ‘quod ea parasitus habeat, qul illum sat sciatl

delicere et noctem iacere possit de die '; Propert. 4, 1, 143, ‘illius arbitrio
noctem lucemque videbis,’ etc. Every one remembers the conversation of

Petruchio and Katharine, ‘I say it is the moon! ‘I know it is the moon.’
‘Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun,' etc. So on the contrary oi one
whose word no man relies on, as in Plautus, Bacchides, 699, ‘si tu illurn
solem sibi solem esse diceres, lse illum lunam credere esse et noctem qui
nunc est dies!

35. Lit. ‘With those words you might wrest from me that (ie. my belief
that) the stars oi heaven shine and that the pathos thunderbolts is bright,'
i.e. ‘convince me that the stars oi heaven do not shine,' etc. No other
example oi erepere with an object clause appears to be quoted. For the
passive with a subject clause cp. Ovid, Met. 2, 483, ‘posse loqui eripitur,’ i.e.
the ability to speak, the power os speech, was taken away. For a clause with ·
quin (analogy oi prohibere) cp. Hor. Sat. 2, 2, 23, ‘vix tamen eripiam . . .
quin velis,' etc. More common with an object clause as here is adimere, but
this too is rare and poetical, cp. (Thes.) Ovid, Pont. 1, 7, 47, ⁸ uec vitam nec
opes, nec ademit posse reverti’; Hor. Epist. t, 19, 93 Sil. Ital. 9, 1603 4253
Tertull. De Anim. 17 ς Plautus, Miles Glor. 588. So occasionally in Pindar and
the tragedy, cp. Pindar,lsthm. 1, 60, πάντα δ’ ἐξειπεῖν . . . ἀφαιρεῖται βραχὺ
μέτρον ἔχων ὕμνος· Soph. Phil. 1302, τί μ’ ἅνδραπολέμιον Ι ἐχθρόν τ’ ἀφείλου
μὴ κτανεῖν τόξοις ἐμοΐςς Eurip. Τ road. 11463 Amlrom.9t3; Happel. 1207 ; etc.

3⁶. puras: ‘clear,’ ‘bright‚’ but here, asin all similar connections (as de·

'manded by its real meaning), always with the accessory notion oi ⁴ undimmed,’
‘unclouded' cp. 4, 1, 10, ‘ut puro testantur sidera caelo,’ i.e. in the un·
clouded, cloudless sky-when they can be seen; Hor. Od. 3, 29, 43, ‘ cras vel
atra Ι nube polum pater occupato, Ι vel sole puro’ (so Byron describing the sun
ol the South in his Curse os Minerva says ‘Not as in northern elimes obscurely
bright, Ι But one unclouded blaze ol living light ') ; 2, 5, 18, ‘non Chloris, albo
sic umero nitens, Ι ut pura nocturno renidet Ι Luna mari,' where para is
defined by the old Schol. as ‘habens serena nocte lumen integrum! In these
phrases, therefore, the proper negative of puras would be nebulosas, or better
still obscuras- and this is really what the poet is thinking os, because the ordi·
nary t'orm ol the thought would not be ⁴ wrest from rne (the conviction) that
the path os the thunderbolt is bright (ie. undimmed)’but rather ‘convince me
that it is dim,’ cp. ag. the description oi this phenomenon as a prodigy by
Lucan, 5, 630, ‘lux etiam metuenda perit, nec fulgora currunt Ι clara, sed
obscurum nimbosus dissilit aer.’-vias: the plural is distributive, cp. sonrnos,
1, 1, 4 and note.
