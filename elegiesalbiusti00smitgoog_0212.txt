speeds them on the way. But not the faint-hearted, not such as fear to rise
by night. lwander whither l will iu the dead of night, yet Venus protecta
me from harm. Lovers are sacrosanct, they should never be dismayed. But
Venus also will have it that her stolen sweets remain concealed. He that
stumbles on a lover had best see no one, hear no one, remember nothing.
The blabber will find to his eost that Venus sprang from blood and the furious
sea. But your husband will not believe the man. Iam assured of it bya
witch to whom all the feats of magic are but as child’s play. She has given
me a charm by which you could escape. Chant it thrice, spit thrice, and no
one can make him suspect us at all, nay, he would not believe his own eyes
even if he saw us together. Note however that the charm will not work for
any one but me.

‘What am 1 to believe? The woman said she could charm me out of love.
1 did not ask that; 1 asked that your love might equal mine. To be happy
without you, such a wish 1 could never entertain. Surely that fellow was an
unfeeling fool who when he might have you preferred war and plunder.
Well, he is welcome to fame aud fortune. For me ahumble shepherd’s life, a
sylvan couch, and you, would be wealth untold. What is life without happy
love? He has no one but himself to blame. But pray what have I done to
be so miserable? Have I sinned against the gods in word 01 deed? If so,
1 will shrink from no penance however severe.

‘But as 101 you (suddenly turning on one of his unfeeling auditore) who
make a moclr of my misfortunes, look to yourself anon! ’Tis a long lane
that has no turning. Ι once knew a man that had always made merry over
the misfortunes of lovers. In his age he became the abject thrall of a young
jade's caprice and furnished a pitiable illustration 01 “ Pride goeth before afall.”

‘But do thou spate me, Venus; 1 have ever been thy devoted servant. Why
destroy that which is thine?'

troubles in drink so that he may fall asleep and forget them. The sooner the
better, hence he calls for merum,· otherwise he would have been content
with the usual proportion of water (the rules are given by Alkaios, 44 Crus. -
an illustrious drinker-see‚ too, Athen. 10, 430), cp. Ovid, Amor. 1, 4, 51,
‘vir bibat usque roga; precibus tamen oscula desint, Ι dumque bibit furtim si
potes adde merum!
