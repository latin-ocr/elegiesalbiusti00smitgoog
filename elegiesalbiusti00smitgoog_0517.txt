attentions were being bestowed elsewhere. Langusgc, syntax, and arrange· ,
ment betray the writer's state of mind. Every line palpitates with the sup· Ι

pressed fury of a passionate, high-spirited Roman gentlewoman who hasbeen

cut to the quick, not only in her love, but in her pride. Probably the recip· Ἴ
ient thought it best to call at once, and as this letter (cp. ⁶ ne . . . cadam,'2 n.) 3
was certainly written before the consummatiou of 4, 7, we know that, though ¹

doubtless utterly bewildered, he must have explained himself to her entire
satisfaction. Indeed, one might reasonably suspect that the situation of 4, 7,

was itself the more or less immediate result of her passionate reaction in his ζ
favour on this occasion. Burton (Anat. Mel. 111, Ill, Ι, ΙΙ), refers to this .
poem with ‘Cerinthus rejected Sulpicia, a nobleman's daughter, and courted l

apoor servant maid!

r-a. These lines have been variously interpreted. They are quite clear,
however, if we bear in mind that Sulpicia has naturally chosen to express her
thought in the form of bitter irony. In the positive form of cooler statement
the thought is, ‘You feel so sure of me now that you allow yourself to do
very much as you please; ii you had set out deliberately to cure me of my

’ love for you, you could not have selectedamore effective method.’ ln the =

ironical form dictated by hcr passion of jeslousy, wounded pride, and dis·
prized love Sulpicia says, ‘l owe you a genuine debt of gratitude for being
so sure of me now that you allow yourself the utmost frecdom so far as Ι am

concerned-,lest forsooth, l might be such a fool of a sudden ss to tumble 1

into your arms! '

r. gratum est: r'.e. ‘gratias ago! hemeah—multum tibi permittis:
Ovid, Trist. 2, 356, ‘plus sibi permisit compositore suo ’3 Her. 8, 393 Propert.
4, 4, 67; Juv. 6, 457, ‘nil non permittit mulier sibi, turpe putat nil,’ etc.-
de me: the regimen is not certain. ‘securus de me' would be most natural
(cp. ‘mutuus de nobis,’ 4, 5, 6 and note), a'nd securus in this sense is not
unfrequently followed by de. The distance, however, of de me from securus
suggests that S. may have been thinking of the complex, ‘securus . . . per·
mittis.' ln that case in me would have been more common.

2. ue. . .cadam: has no point unless we suppose that the consumma· l
tion of 4, 7, is still in the future. The clause is a clause of ‘perverse purpose
running into consequence,' a usage especially characteristic of caustie
language; Cerinthus has no idea of losing Sulpicia's love-she herself

has just said it (securus)—still less is hc trying to lose it. Such being
the case his action is so foolish that the inevitable result of that action, the
loss of her love, seems nothing short of a deliberate purpose. For a good
parallel cp. Caesar’s eaustic remark in B. G. 5, 31, 5, ‘omnia excogitantur
quare nec sine periculo maneatur et languore militum et vigiliis periculum
