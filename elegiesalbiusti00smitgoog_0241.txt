6. mestos sinus: possibly hypallage (cp. Verg. A.11‚ 35, ‘et maestum
Iliades crinem de more solutae ’), no doubt, too, with a suggestion of nigra
vestis, the mourning garb- though this is not proved by Lygdamus’s imitation,
3, 2, 17. For hypallage inTib. see r,4, 10 n. ⁵

7. Assyrios: ie. Syrios as in Catullus, 66, ι2; Vergil, E. 4, 253 Horace,
· Od. 2, 11, 16, and often. Perfumes were habitually known as Syrian because
the products of the East carne overland by caravan and were shipped to Greece
and Rome from-Syrien ports, more especially Petra aud Gaza. Most of the
odores really came from Arabia, as Tibullus (cp. 2, 2, 3) was himself aware.
—0doresz the use of perfumes and unguenta for this purpose is often men-
tioned, cp. Aiscb. Agom. 13rr; Bion, 1, 703 Propert. 2, 13, 303 3,16, 23,
etc. Their use for the funeral fire itself —a vast expense much discussed and
criticized by the. thiulrers of antiquity-is another matter.

8. fleat: 1, ι, 65-66 n.-etlusis comis: 1, 1, 67 n.—sapulcra: for the
plural the analogy of mones (1, 1, 67) is quoted. The plural, however, may
be indefinite or because the poet for the moment saw not only his own tomb,
but those of his lrirldred around it, cp. 1, 1, 4 n. Perhaps too sepulcra is
partly ⁴due to the analogy of funera, as iu Propert. 2, r, 56, ‘ex hac ducentur
funera nostra domo,' aud often, cp. ‘Come therefore, and to Thasos send his
bodyt Ι llis funerals shall not be in our camp’- Shak.

9. non usquam: corresponds to and emphasizes the non tric of 5, cp. Hor.
Sat. r, 6, r4; Livy, 8, 1, 7, ete-mitteret: Catull. 66, 29, ‘sed tum maesta
virum mittens quae verba locuta es’3 Verg. A. 11, 47, ‘me conplexus euntem
mitteret in magnum imperium: etc.

ro. anta: adverbial.

1'1-12. Divination hy sortes (cp. also r, 8, 33 2, 5, 13) was widespread in
Italy and prevalent from the earliest times. Their use was general in the
various temples (the most famous being the temple of Fortuna at Praeneste,
cp. also the famous sortes Vergilianoe of a later date); but sortilegi also plied
their trade in the Circus aud other crowded parts of the city (Hor. Sat. 1, 6,
114; 1, 9, 303 Cicero, Dio. 1, 1323 Juv. 6, 583, ete). The sortes were pieces
of wood or other material inscribed with some conveniently indefinite state-
ment. These were placed iu an uru (situla, Plautus, Casino, 359 fl, etc.) and
shuffled. Tbeu one, or one at a time, was drawn out and its meaning inter-
preted hythe sortilegus (cp. the amusing passage in Apuleius, Met. 9, 8).
The two lines before us describe Delia’s method of consulting the sortes to
find whether it will be saie for Tib. to go with Messalla. The process is not
clear in the traditional text and no emendation (if emendation is needed) is
entirely satisfactory. Adopting Muretus's trinis for the traditional triviis,
the plain meaning is that Delia herself drew a lot three times (for luclr) in
