NOTES [2, 4, 8

Agesis often represented in contemporary prints. A final touch to the picture
is given by iol-the victim’s shout of agony as the torch is forced against the
live flesh.

5. merui . . . peccavimus: on the shift to the plural see 1, 2, 11 n.

7-10. The sufferet becomes articulate aud thereafter discusses with the
calmness of despair the details of his situation. The formation of the sen-
tence reflects the agony of the speaker— (1.) the exclamatory o ega (cp. 2, 3,
5); (2) the desire to be free, which is the first articulate thought ; (3) yes, at
any price (hence ne . . . possim, final subjunctive), ‘to be incapable of feel·
ing such torture’; (4) ‘how gladly would 1 have been even,’ etc. (quam
mallem, optative subjunctive of the wish with adverse decision, cp. Gilder·
alaeve-longe, 261 Rem, and 4, 13, 5 n).

7. Carm. Epig. 1211, 9, ‘sed quoniam multi talem sensere dolorem,’ is
cited as an imitation.

8-10. The stom-beaten crag hythe sea is a proverb of adversity, cp. eg.
Soph. 0. K. 1240. More often the ‘tall rock,’ as the old play says, that
‘maintains majestic state, Ι Though Boreas gallop on the tottering aeas,l
And tilting spit his froth out, spurging waves Ι Upon his surly breast’ (cp.
Shirley's ‘rock that bids Ι Defiance to a storm, against whose ribs Ι The inso-
lent waves but dash themselves in pieces, Ι And fall and bide their heads in
passionate foam') is a proverb of one who stands firm against adversity, the
shock of battle, etc., cp. Homer, Il. 15, 6183 Verg. A. 7, 586; 10, 6933
Ovid, Met. 9, 40; Seneca, Vit. Beat. 27, 3 ; etc. But rock is also a proverb
of the hard and the unfeeling, cp. 1, 1, 63-64 n. The phrases ‘ne . . . dolores’
in 7 and ‘gelidis . . . lapis' in 8 indicate that this was the point of the poet’s
comparison here. This turn to the old simile is comparatively uncommon, cp. ’
however Hor. Epod. 17, 54 (which Tib. ,may possibly have had in mind),
‘non saxa nudis surdiora navitis Ι Neptunus alto tundit hibernus salo ’ς Ovid,
pont. ι, 2, 31, ‘felicem Nioben, quamvis tot funera vidit, Ι quae posuit sen·
sum, saxea facta, mali! Ι vos quoque felices, quarum clamantia fratrem Ι cortice
velavit populus ora novo. Ι ille ego sum lignum quinon admittar in ullum: Ι
ille ego sum frustra qui lapis esse velim. Ι . . . vivimus, ut numquam seusu
careamus amaro, Ι et gravior longa fit mea poena mora!

8. The simile is not common, cp., however, Thomas Edward Brown,
Jessa'e,12-

0 thou my heartl O thou my useless heartl
Would God thal thou wert dead-

A clod insensible to joys or ills-
Α stone remote ln some bleak gully of the hillsf Ι

Guy de Tours, Souspirs, 1, 29, seems to be echoing Tibullus -
