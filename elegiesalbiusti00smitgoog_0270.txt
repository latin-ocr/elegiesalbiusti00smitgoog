Theolrrit. r, 81 and Schol, also Epig. 3,-which suggest that one of the
favourite stories at that time was the rivalry of Pan and Priapos for the favours
of Daphnis) and the characteristic Alex. tone of semi-sentimental mockery
persists, as here, in many of the later references, ag. Anah. Pal. 5, 200; 9,
3385 437; ¹622373 2403 ²4¹3 ²433 Priap.3; 53 73 113 133 153 Lumen,
Dial. Dear. 23; etc.

4-5. ln surviving art the beard of Priapos is usually thin and straggling.
He himself complains (Priap. 63, 5) that, ‘et in capillos grandines cadunt
nostros Ι rigetque dura barba vincta crystallo'

5. nudus: Priap. 14, 8; 16, 8. Probably to be talren literally,asthe poet
appears to have in mind either the Herm-type or more lilrely the rough figure
of wood.

6. Cp. Hor. Sat. 2, 5, 39, ‘seu rubra Canicula findet Ι infantis statuas.' On
the proverbial heat of dog-days, 42 ; 1, 1, 27 n.

7. tum: Tibullus prefers tunc, cp. 1, 1, 21; 1, 6, 21 and notes-proles:
the pedigree of Priapos is unsettled, cp. Class. Dict. Tib. follows the most
common tradition, cp. Ana, Pal. 10, 2, 8; 15, 8; Diod. Sic. 4, 6, 13 etc.
The epithet rustica is frequent and eminently fitting, Anth. Pal. 6, 22, 5; ⁶
Ovid, Trist. 1, ro, 263 Priap. 14, 73 68, r; 81,1,etc.

8. sic: goes with repandit. The unusual distance is atuned for by the
fact that the displaced word begins the second hemistich and is therefore in
an emphatic position, cp. 1, 3, 56; 1, 6, 32 and 4o; r, 10, 6, 8and16; r, 9,
243 2,1,78; 2, 5, 14 and 963 4, 5, 163 4, 6, 6, 4, 11, 4. less frequent in
Ovid, cp. Amor. r, 2, ¹4· '

956. Priapus de Arte Amandi. Note the ironical exaggeration of the
didactic attitude, as seen for instance in the sly emphasis upon a systematis
arrangement and development of topics. Usually informal and certainly
never impressive in appearance, Priapos has suddenly assumed the rdle of the
conventionalized professor. As such he is dignified, formal, dogmatis, precise,
· hispronouncements purposely axiomatis and familiar, his illustratione purposely
traditional and commonplace, although both are announced with all the air of
being great and useful discoveries. Note too the assumption of that intense
seriousness, of that almost reverential altitude toward an utterly trivial theme
—the characteristic attitude for example of the gastronomic expett-which
Ovid reproduced to perfection in his Ars Amatoria, the most brilliant satire
of its lrind now existing. Indeed Wilhelm has noted the close parallelism
between -the Ars Amatoria and tlris passage in the matter of topics and their
arrangement, eg. 9-r4= A. A. 3, 381-384, cp. Amor. 2, 4, ro; ¹5·²⁰ =
A. A. 1, 469-478, cp. 2, 177-1843 21-26 = A. A. 1, 631-6363 27-28 = A. A.
