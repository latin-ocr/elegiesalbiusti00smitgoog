48, inulta: νζι. ‘with impunity,’ ‘without suffering the consequences,’
‘unhurt.' For this rare meaning (Scaliger compared the ἀθῶον of Demosth.
316, 18) see innoxia, 2, 5, 63n.

49. etat: 1, 1, 64 n.-·veru : the Indians run thorns or slrewers through

5ο. monet: ‘foretells,’ so Verg. E. 9, 155 A. 3, 71²³ 7, 41 ; etc.

· 51-54. A horrid prelude for such a trivia] matter but we have the authority
of Juvenal that Bellona was not above giving advice on any occasion, 4, 123 ;
6,511. Cp. 1, 2, 27-28 n.

51. In Carm. Epig. 953 Β, ‘si quis forte meam cupiet violare puellam!
illumin desertis montibus urat amor' (Pompeian graffito), the cadence of the
hex. suggests Tib. On violare, r, 3, 81 n. -parcite violare r so also Lygd.
3, 5, 6, instead of the usual prosaic nolite violare, see 1, 4, 9 n. noli or
nolite with the infin. as a circumlocution for the imperative does not occur
in Tib.. is not quoted for Ovid, and but two exx. are found in Propertius
(2,18,37; 2, 24, 49). In fact Tib. uses nolo only in the uncompounded
forms, νῖν. non vis, non vult, etc., and only six exceptions to this rule are
quoted forOvid (Her. 17, ²43 2ο, 100 ; Trist. r, 2, 93 t Fast. 4, ιον, 5, 471 ;
Met. 13, 863). Propertius has six, without the twojust cited. Forparcereas

which is done with appropriate ceremonial shall be repeated when, where,

therefore frequentin prayers, curses, bans, and solemn ceremonial generally.

The old commentators here have in one or two instances noted that the
poet's curse is confined to ‘labentur opes,’ the loss of wealth. The point is
well made, for the curse is aimed at the dives amator who without his money

would be nothing, cp. 2, 4, 39 and 1, 9, 13-16 n.
