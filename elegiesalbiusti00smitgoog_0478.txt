As soon as the prayer was finished it was a part of the ceremonial for
every one to drink as much as he could hold of the specific beverage pre-

scribed for this occasion, viz. sapa (new wine boiled down thick) mixed with
new milk and set out in large wooden bowls (camellae). When the required

point of ceremonial hilarity had been reached (87) the last and most im·
portant portion of the ritual was performed. Heaps of hay and straw were
lighted and every one proceeded to leap through the fire three times (89-903
Ovid above3 Persius, 1, 72 and Schol.; Dionys. 1, 88, 13 Probus on Verg.
G. 3, 1 ; Propert. 4, 1, 19 ; 4, 77, etc). This famous old custom of lustration
by fire has been practised all over Europe as well asin the Orient,andin
more than one locality still survives. After this was over the company, as in
all such rustic festivals, devoted the rest of the ‹lay to metm-making (95-104).

Regular is setus cdere, cg. Verg. G. 4, 199, etc, or in the ordinary speech,
flucre: subolem facere, eg. in the Script. R. R. is regular of animab, cp.

Tibullus. Not infrequent iu Lucret., Vergil, aud Ovid, esp. of animals, plants,
and things. setus, of human beiugs, is very rare.
