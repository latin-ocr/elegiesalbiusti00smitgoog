INTRODUCrION

the Alexandrian Age, and though allos them, even the purely
narrative type and the elegiae epigram, are both in matter and
forma natural growth from the elegy ol earlier days, we may
nevertheless agree with the Romans that the flower os the elegy
on its native soil was during the Hellenistic period.¹

1The burning question here is the pedigree ol the specitic Roman type. 'Ibe
first extant examples ol the subjective erotic elegy occur among the Romans.
Was this an invention ol their own, or had they been anticipated by the Alexan·
drian poets? For the literature ol the subject up to 1905 see Gollnisch, Quaes-
tiones Elegiacae, Diss.. Breslau, 1905 (rev. by Jacoby, Berl. Phil. Wocherrschr.
1905, p. 1208). The discussion first assumes importance with Leo, Plautinische
Forschungen‚ 1895, pp. 126 l.; see, also, oon. Gel. Ana. 1⁸98· p. 722, and his De
Horatio et Archilocho, Gdtt„ 190a Among further contributions special promi·
nence should be given to R. Reitzenstein, Epignomm und Sholion, and his article
ou the Epigram in P-W. 6, pp.71-111; Jacoby, ‘Zur Entstehung der Rdmischen
Elegie,' Rhein. Mus. 60, 38-105; A. L. Wheeler, Closs. Philol. 5, 440—45o; 6,
56-77; 5, 28-40. Mention should also be made oi M. Rothstein, Ehrleil. au
Propera, and Philol. 1900, p. 441; Hoelzer, De Poesi Amatoria a Comicis Allicit
exculta ab Elegiacis imitatione expressa, Diss, Marburg, 1899; Biirger, De Ovi-
dii Carm. Amal. etc.. Braunschweig, 19013 Mallet, Quaeri. Properh 1882; M.
Heinemann, ‘ EpistulaeAmat. quomodo cohaereant cum Elegiis Alexandrinis,' Diss.
Argentoral. 14, 3, Strassburg, 1910 (see Jacoby, Berl. Phil. ll'ochemchr. 1911,
pp. 169-173). The solution offered by Wheeler‚ hc , deserves particular considera·
tion, and his review and criticism ol the discussion is timely and convincing.

A definite and final answer to the question is precluded by the practically
complete loss ol the Alexandrian elegy. Two possibilities remain. One is the
references in later writers (Propertius and Ovid, Quintilian, Diomedes, ete).
Experience has shown that these are ol no value perse. Antique' criticism is more
concemed with lorm and style than with content or genre. All that remains is to
collect the numerous passages in various types of Greek literature which parallel
or prefigure the characters, motives, and situations ol Roman elegy (hence the
large number ol such parallels collected during the past 15 years). Parallelism,
however, is neither a proof nor a test ol immediate origin. ll in a given ease, as
Wheeler well says, ‘the lact ol influence has been demonstrated and the earliest,
ie. the ultimate, Greek source hasbeen pointed out, the most difficult question
still remains: By what channel did the Greek influenee reach Roman elegy ?'

Leo's view (l borrow Wheeler's briei outline) is that ‘the many agreements
between Roman elegy and Roman comedy indicate that Greek New comedy is
the ultimate source ol the comio motives in Roman elegy, for the Augustan ele-
gists did not read Plautus and Terence. But the Augustan elegists did not use
the νέα directly, as the older scholars (eg. Huschke, etc.) thought; rather the in-
fluence came indirectly through the medium ol the Alexandrian poets, especially
the elegists, whom Propertius and Ovid acknowledge as their models. The Alexan-
drians had already taken over the motives ol comedy, each poet modiiying thern
irom personal experienoe and from lile. The material ol comedy appears in
