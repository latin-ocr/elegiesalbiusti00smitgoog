3. That is, ‘ cura togae et scortum quasillo pressum sit tibi potior quam,’ etc.
—togaer genitive, 1, 9, 34. For the implication see 1, 6, 67-68 ιι. Sulpicia
here uses it as a scornful designation of the lower demi-monde in general, and
then passes at once to the specific ‘pressum quasillo scortum—quasillo:
the quasillum was the basket containing the regular stint of wool given to
the spinner for a day’s work, cp. eg. Propert. 4, 7, 41 (Cynthia speaking of
her rival and successor), ‘et graviora rependit iniquis pensa quasillis, Ι garrula
de facie siqua locuta mea est,’ etc. By pressum quasillo, ‘loaded with her
basket of wool,’ S. refers graphically to a quasillaria or ‘basket-wench,' the
spinning girl, who in distinction from the regular ancillae of a household had
to endure the opprobrium of being obliged to spin for a living. The hours were
long (from daylight to bedtime, cp. Ovid, Amor. 1, 13, 23; Tib. 1, 3, 87, etc),
the work tedious and unremunerative (Anile. Pal. 6, 39; 284 and 285), hence,
the character given her in this passage, like the character regularly ascribed
to the laundress lin our old plays, reflects a prevailing opinion ruore or
less well founded, cp. Petron. 132, ‘mulier . . . convocat omnes quasillarias

familiaeque sordidissimam partem,’ etc.

5-6. ‘There are those interested in our behalf whose greatest cause for con·
cern is the fear lest I may be slighted for a base-born paramour)

5. solliciti, etc: the sentence suggests that the original source of ber infor·
mation regarding Cerinthus was one of ‘ those persons interested in their behalf'
(Cerinthus would have called him a rival), and that under cover of the interr-
tionally vague and impressive plural she is really quoting a part of what her
informant told her on that occasion—nobis: probably a genuine plural, de.
Cerinthus and herself-dolori est: de. ‘quibus illa maxima causa dolori est ne,’
etc: Rigler’s doloris here (adopted by Haupt-Vahlen, etc.) for ‘dolori est’
seems unnecessary, as thedouble dative (cp. 4, 7, 1 and 1, 5, 29 n.) with causa
is attested by Tacitus, Ann. 16, 14, 3, ‘eamque causam multis exitio esse,’ and
Pliny, Epist. 6, 28, 1, ‘scio quae tibi causa fuerit impedimento)

⁶. toro: this passage is ambiguous, and on the whole the most troublesome in
Sulpicia’s poems. Many translate ‘ne ignoto toro cedam’ by ‘lest Ι may yield
to, i.e. be persuaded into, an obscure marriage,' and cite the phrase so inter-
preted in support of the theory that Cerinthus was of low birth. There is
nothing, however, to show that C. was of low birth, and even granting that he
was, can we believe that even in her present state of mind S. would have taunted
him with it? On the contrary it is reasonable to assume that he was a Roman
of birth and position, see Introd. p. 86. 1t seems better therefore to take
cedere in its common sense of ‘give way to,’ ie. ‘retire before,’ ‘give up the
field to.’ ln that case, ignoto toro means the quasillaria, not Cerinthus, and
