“ expect it of one so thoroughly steeped in the diction and style of
the Homeric poems. To the same cause has been traced that
tendency to idealize the past which is a specilic aspect not only of
Mimnermos himself in his sentimental-erotic mood but after him
of the entire elegy.

To the period of Solon belongs the growth of the inscription in
distichs. The acknowledged classic is Simonides and the type
was continued by Aischylos and Phrynichos. ¹

The period of Attic supremacy was marked by the rise of
prose and of the drama. F or the 'time being the elegy was rel-

egated to the background as amere parergon of writers whose
real farne was derived from their work in other fields Neverthe·

less the Attic school-the best representatives of it were Ion,
Evenos, and Kritias —rnarks an advance. The influence of lyric
and tragedy and of the new rhetorical technique of the sophists
is to be felt in certain details.

The transition' from the Old elegy to the New is represented by
Antimachos of Kolophon, and it is significant for the character of
the type soon to come that the intellectual and artistic pedigree
of its great precursor takes us back to his fellow townsman
Mimnermos. Upon the death of his beloved Lyde, Antimachos
consoled himself for his loss by composing elegies in her honour,
in which he retold from legend stories of those who like himself
had loved and lost. The -byde was thus a special develop-
ment of the old threnodic nrood. So too this use of myth, to
which as the author of a famous epic (the Thebais) he would

. naturally be inclined, takes us back to Mimnermos. But this use

of myth which appears to have been only occasional even in
Mimnermos becomes in Antimachos for the first timea settled
principle of elegiae composition afterwards used to advantage by
the Hellenistic poets. His careful elaboration of details and his
more extensive use of metaphorical diction, for both of which he ’
was famous, also characterize him as a genuine forerunner of the
New elegy.
