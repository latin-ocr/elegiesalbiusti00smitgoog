NOTES - [2, 5, 71

dicitur tenens in manu librum; cuius sortes senatus in Capitolium trans-
tulerit!

⁶9. quaeque: i.e. ‘quodque admonuit quae,’ etc—Aniene flumina: this
adjective (Auienus) is Vergilian, cp. G. 4, 369, ‘unde pater Tiberinus, et
unde Aniena fluenta.¹ The remaining exx. quoted by the Thes. are confined
to Propertius,1, 20, 8; 3, 16, 4; Stat. Silv. 4, 4, 17.

70. portarit pertuleritque: 101 the combination Postgate quotes Seneca, ’
Ben. 3, 37, 1, ‘Aeneas tulit illum per ignes et (quid non pietas potestr)
pertulit' -portarin see 2, 3, 69 n. ’

71-78. These prophecies 01 the Sibyls mentioned all the portents by which
the death ol Julius and the Civil Wars were attended lt hardly seems neces·
sary to suspect a lacuna between 70 aud 71. The poet has just dealt at length
with the Sibyl and the propheey 01 paramount importance 101 his present
purpose. The Sibyls 01 65-70 were all important to Messalinus as one 01 the
X Vviri, but 101 this poem their only use is to introduce the Civil Wars, that
Valley 01 the Shadow through which Rome has just struggled to the new
regime, and with Apollo's help to the final realization ol that ancient proph-
ecy to the great ancestor 01 the reigning emperor. The topic 01 the Civil
Wars should be brief and not too prominent, as befits elegy in general and
the subject, character, and object 01 this elegy in particular.

As the La'bri Sibyllini were mainly consulted with regard to portents it was
natural to develop the theme 01 the Civil Wars 110111 this point 01 view. Be·
sides, the portents attending the Civil Wars and the death 01 the great dictator
were especially lrightlul and were remembered 101 generations. Apart from
this passage 01 Tibullus we also have Vergil, G. 1, 463-488, Ovid, Met. 15,
782-800, Manilius, 1, 905 1. , Obsequens, 68 (which probably represents the
passage in Livy); Horace, od. 1, 2, 1-20, Appian, B. C. 4, 4, 14 ; Cassius Dio,
45,17 (ep.41,14); Petron. 122, Lucan, 1, 524; Plutarch, Caes. 63 and 68.

The long parenthesis serves to explain and restrict the sweeping statement
0167-70. 800 79 n. below.

71. haec: sem. plur. subject 01 dixerunt, rie. the Sibyls just mentioned.
The lorrn is not common but Schulze cites it sor Catullus, 64, 320, and 101 the
Augustan period Neue (II, 417) cites Vergil, G. 3, 305, Ovid, Fasti, 3, 6845
cp. also Juv. 6, 569, 592, etc. e

lt has been the general belief the world over that comets portend change
or disaster 101 the people at large, especially war, plague, 01 the death ol
rulers. ‘When beggars die there are no comets seen, 1 The heavens thern*
selves blaze forth the death 01 princes,’ says Calpurnia to Caesar himself, cp.
Verg. A. 10, 272, Tac. Ann. 14, 22, Sueton. Nero, 36; Lucan, 1, 529, Manil.
1, 876; Pliny, 2, 92, Lydus, De Ostentis, 10, Milton, P. L. 2, 708, and 011011.
