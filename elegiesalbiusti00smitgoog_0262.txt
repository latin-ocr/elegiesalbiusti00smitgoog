opposite directions and emptying into it on opposite sides. The fact that
Phlegethon rolls on in floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire does not
exclude necessarily the epithet of nr'gra. Milton's ‘flames that give no light:
but rather darkness visible,’ is a favourite figure of the Roman poets in the
, description of things infernal. Tibullus’s expression, however, is purposely in·
definite.

69-70. The conception of the Furies'as tormentors bf the wicked in Hades
appears even in Homer (Odyss. 20, 77, cp. Aisch. Eumen. 321), hence their

’ later name of Poinar'. In the native Roman tradition this office seems to

bave been intrusted to the spirits of the dead (Seneca, Apocol. 93 Pliny,
H. N. 1, Praesat. 31). In the Axioch. 371 C,they are already established as
the chief tormentors, and in later references the torcb and esp. the scourge
are rarely absent. The Roman poets usually agree with Tib. in representing
Tisiphone as the torturer par excellence. Pausanias, 1, 28, 6, says that Aiscby·
los was the first to represent the Furies with snakes in their hair. The detail
is rarely forgotten by the Roman poets, but in all cases it is either distinctly
stated that the snakes are intertwined with the hair, or else (as inverg. A.
7, 329, and Ovid, Met. 4, 784, cp. 801), the matter is left undecided. Tibul·
lus’s bold and striking expression ‘with uncombed snakes in lieu of hair’ clearly
reflects the idea that the Furies had no bair at all, but only a tangled snarl of
hissing serpents—which reminds one at once of the famous picture of Medusa
(once ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci) in the Uffizi Gallery.

met assoon as one leaves Cbaron’s boat, and that the specific guardian of
Tartaros is his sister the Hydra. scelerata sedes, however, is indefinite, and
Tib. gives no specific details of infernal topography.

siphone, the warden Kerberos (first named in Hesiod, Theog. 311) frightens
them away from the door and prevents any from escaping. Kerberos devours
all whom he finds out of bounds. This explains Plutarch’s remark (Mor.
1105 A) that ‘any one would willingly be devoured by Kerberos if only he
might remain alive,’ cp. also Hesiod, Theog. 769 ; Quintus Smyrn. 6, 261. —
