developed thus: First distich (39-40), general statement; second and third
disticm (41-44), first illustration‚ travel by land; fourth and fifth distichs
(45-48), second illustration‚ travel by sea; sixth distich (49-50), third illus
tration, hunting; seventh distich (51-52), fourth illustration‚ lencing; eighth
and ninth disticha (53-56), general conclusion. For the theme, which goes ’
back to the Alex. Age, cp. esp. Ovid‚ Ars Amat. 2, 179, a passage reminis-

have seen, 1, i, 26 n., is often military. Here, however, as is shown by
42-44, it meansalong walk. Il he organizes a long walk (as such people are
likely to do, tegardless os the weather), go with him. Never mind is it is hot
and dusty or, on the other hand, is it threateus to rain in torrents. All three
things are likely to be disagreeab'le, not only a long walk as such (your ele-
giae lover is no athlete, cp. Irrtrod. p. 56), but the two extremes of westher
described. Hence, the compendious sentence, in which quamvis (43) appar-
ently corresponds to quamvis (41), and et (42) may = a paratactic ‘and’ as
iu English. Logically, however, the wallr is the thing, the extremes oi westher,
