magician splits the ground so that the ghosts can hear bis incantation (i.e.
be reached and affected by it) and then can come straight up to him from
Hades : cp., eg„ Seneca, Oedipus, 571, ⁴ “ audior ” vates ait, Ι “ rata verba fudi:
rumpitur caecum chaos Ι iterque populis Ditis ad superos datur.’‘ Ι .. . subito
dehiscit terra et immenso sinu Ι laxata patuit — ipse torpentes lacus Ι vidi inter
umbras, ipse pallentes deos Ι noctemque veram; gelidus in venis stetit Ι bae·
sitque sanguis. saeva prosiluit cohors Ι et stetit in armis omne vipereum
genus,' Ι etc.; Lucan, 6, 728, ‘perque cavas terrae quas egit carmine rimas Ι ’
manibus inlatrat regnique silentia rumpit: etc. Amate'urs and even profes-
sionals who had not fully mastered this interesting detail were usually content
to perform the regular ceremonial (described at some length in Seneca, Le.
560 f. ; Odyssey, ιι, 24, cp. Horace, Sat. 1, 8, 26, etc.) and to take. the result·
ing convulsion of nature for granted.

ter Elicius (Fast. 3, 285). -devocat, etc. ε she spirits away the bones of the
corpse before the funeral pile is cold; cp. Lucano, 533, ‘fumantis iuvenum
cineres ardentiaque ossa Ι e mediis rapit illa rogis ipsamque parentes Ι qnam
tenuere lacem nigroque volantia fumo Ι feralis fragmenta tori vestesque
fluentes Ι colligit in cineres et olentis membra favillas) etc.; Claudian, In
Rufi r, 154, ‘saepius horrendos manes sacrisque litavi Ι nocturnis Hecaten,
et condita lunera traxi Ι carminibus victura meis,' etc.

Parts of the human body, above all when, as here, sccured under exceptional
circumstances, have always been much songht by the witcbes; cp. the follr
tale told by Trimalchio in Petronius, 633 the strange story in Apuleius,
Met. 2, 21, etc. Tbisis one of the principal reasons why, in all ages,
the corpse bas been so carefully watched before burial. In this particular
case the ossa, esp. when so secured, would doubtless be considered in them·
selves a charin of power. Here, however, the connection shows that the
witcb secures the ossa as a preliminary to securing the ghost of ¹their late
owner, ie. in accordance with the doctrine of sympatby the part (bair, nails
garments, or ‘exuviae ' of any sort), when aided by the appropriate ceremonial
can always draw the whole to itself. To get baclr a recreant lover, for exam-
ple, one needs first of all to possess something with which he has been inti·
mately associated. This universal law of magio plays a prominent part in the
love charrn associated with ‘drawing down the moon,' 43 n, 57-58 n.; cp.
Theokritos, 23 Verg. E. 83 the ludicrous story in Apuleius, 2, 32-3, 19.
