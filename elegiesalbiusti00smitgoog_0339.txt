The nearest approach to it is illustrated by such passages as Milton, P. L.
4, 135, ‘The champaign head Ι Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides}
With thiclret overgrown, grotesque and wild, Ι Access denied.’ In the way
of taste however all things are possible. ‘l remember when I was a boy,t
says Dryden in his dedication to The Spanish Friar, ‘l thought inimitable
Spenser a mean poet in comparison of Sylvester’s Du Bartas, and was rapt
into an ecstasy when l read these lines-

⁴' Now, when the winter's keener breath began
To crystallina the Baltic ocean;
To glaze the lakes, to bridle up the floods,
And periwig with snow the bald-pate woods.'''

All which will serve to illustrate the rule that English trees may have heads
’ and even crowns and English mountains may be bald, but they never have
hair, and therefore wigs even in the seventeenth century should be taboo. See
2,1,48n.; 1,4,30.

3⁶· incultis pedibus: the emphasis on previous ignorance aud inex-
perience throughout this passage (‘ inexpertae. . ,non notis. . ,nescia')
suggests that incultis here means ‘rude,’ ‘untrained’ (and so among others,
Dissen and Haupt). On the other hand, incultis = sordidis, i.e. stained and
sticlry with the juice of the grapes they are treading (not to mention cou-
tributory matter from other sources) isa detail often noticed by the poets
and certainly warranted by the facts. Cp. Tibullus, 2, 5, 85 (whose tendency
to repeat himself often has been mentioned above); Propert.3,17,18,‘et
nova pressantis inquinet uva pedes’; Ovid, Met. 2, 29, ‘stabat et Autumnus
calcatis sordidus uvis,’ etc. (so Schulze after Cyllenius, Gebhard, etc.) I can-
not find however that incultus is used elsewhere in this sense of sordidus and
should therefore prefer the meaning of ‘rude,’ ‘untrained’ as demanded not
only by the usual meaning of the word but by the surroundings 'of it in this
particular passage.

³7·42· Developed again in 2, 1, 51 from a slightly different point of view.
In the plain prose of the philosophers and literary critics the origin of music
and the dance is to be found in the harvest and vintage festivals of the coun-
try follr. The poets never weary of this theme. It might be observed too
that just about this time the Romans were especially interested in it. Varro
had discussed the matter not long before, Livy was soon to worlr it up for
his history (7, 2), and Tibullus’s friend Horace for his Epistles ( 2, 1, 139, etc).

It goes without saying that the equation Osiris = Bacchos, established be·
fore the time of Herodotus (2, 42) and thoroughly elaborated by the Alex·
andrian thinirers, was now an article of faith (Diodoros, 1, 16).
