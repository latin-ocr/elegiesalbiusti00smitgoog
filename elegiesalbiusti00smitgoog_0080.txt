solution. The passage in question together with the context is
3³ 5» Ι5 s·-

et nondum cani nigros laesere capillos,
nec venit tardo curva senecta pede.

natalem primo nostrum videre parentes,
cum cecidit fato consul uterque pari.

quid fraudare iuvat vitem crescentibus uvis
et modo nata mala vellere poma manu?

Now Ovid, also bom in 43, uses incidentally the same' line tn
describe the date (Tn'st 4, 10‚6)—

editus hic ego sum: necnon ut tempora noris,
cum cecidit fato consul uterque pari.

Note too that Lygdamus, lines 19-20 practically=0vid‚ Amor. 2,
14» ²s·²4 -

quid plenam fraudes vitem crescentibus uvis
' pomaque crudeli vellis acerba manu?

and that Lygdamus, line 16=0vid, Ars. Amat. 2, 670-

ianr veniet tacito curva senecta pede.

The coincidence is so close that we must assume one of the two
to be imitating the other.¹ But which? For either choice is
open to grave objection. Itis most natural to suppose, and the
'majority of scholars favour this view, that Lygdamus imitated
Ovid. If so, he imitated a passage (Trist. 4, 10, 6) published
not earlier than 11-13 nn, and the poet who alludes so feelingly
to his tender youth was between 55 and 60 years of age! A
satisfactory explanation of this objection is yet to be offered. We
might say that he was writing nunc pro tunc, we might say that
the entire affair, except the date, was a dramatic fiction, but we
have no proof, and the probabilities are against us. On the other
hand if Ovid was the imitator, why for this particular fact did he
use the same line, and why was it that no less than three times in
