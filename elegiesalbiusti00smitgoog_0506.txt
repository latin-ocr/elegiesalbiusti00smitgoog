nores [1119

was also the genius of the lectus genialis, and therefore that in view of her
relations with Cerinthus (cp. ‘dulcissima furta,’ 7), infidelity to her was also
a sin against the Genius; cp. ag. Juv. 6, 22 (describing adulterers), ‘sacri
genium contemnere fulcri.'

1³·14· 4, 5, 6-7, 6, 7-8, 1, 2, 63-64 n.; Ter. Eun. 91, ‘O Thais, Thais
utinam esset mihi Ι pars aequa amoris tecum ac pariter fieret 1 et aut hoc tibi
doleret itidem ut mihi dolet 1 aut ego istuc abs te factum nili penderem’;
Catull. 76, 233 Ovid, Met. 14, 24; Amor. 1, 3, 23 Propert. 2, 15, 15, Anuli.
Pal. 5, 88; Aristainet. 1, 16, etc. So Congreve says to his ‘pious Selinda'-

Would thou couldst make of me a saint,
Or 1, of thee, a sinuerl

In view of the large number of parallels, Petrarch, Son. 49, ‘non prego gia?
etc, cannot be called an echo of our passage.

Antique, as well as modern, poetry is full of references to the joy of love
returned in equal measure: ‘mutuis animis amant amantur,' says Catullus
(45, 20); ‘iam nec spes animi credula mutui,’ says Horace (Od. 4, 1, 3ο),
, with a sigh which hasbeen echoed more than once the world over. The
figure suggested here of a well-matched team, each performing his part, is a
favourite with Horace and Propertius; cp. Hor. 01139, 17; 1, 35, 28, Epod.
15, 13, Propert. 1, 5, 23 3, 25, 8; Theokrit. 12,15. ¹

quos dederint annos mihi fila sororum Ι vivere contingat teque dolente
mori’

15. teneamur uterque: 1, 6, 39; 4, 4, 26 n.

16. soluisse: 1, 1, 29-32 m, ‘may no day in the future be able to put us
asunder.’ The perfect emphasizes attslnment, Propert. 1, 1, 15 (commenting
on Milanion’s streuuous, but finally successful, courtship of Atalanta the hunt·
ress), ‘ergo velocem potuit domuisse puellam,’ ‘and thus was he able at last
to achieve the taming of the suist-footed maid’; cp. 1, 17, 1 ; 2, 16, 3; Ovid,
Amor. 3, 2, 3ο, etc.

17-18. On the situation cp. Introd. p. 85, and 1, 4, 14 n.
