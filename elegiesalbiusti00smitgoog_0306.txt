45. Nereis: after Νηρηίς, so Catull. 64, 153 Culex, 300 and 3455 Stat.
Achill.1,527,etc. Also Nereis, after Νηρείς, Ovid, Met. 11, 259; 13, 749;
Sil. Ital. 14, 572; Stat. Achill. 1, 24, etc. The choice appears to be a mere
matter of metrical convenience.

46. caerula: a natural epithet of sea deities and of Thetis in particular,
cp. Hor. Epod. 13, 16; Stat. Achill. 1, 6503 Propert. 2, 9, ¹5³ Ovid, Met. 13,
288. He means of course that 'lbetis’ eyes were blue, the colour of her
native element The figure is not uncommon, cp.. Hor. Epod. 16, 7, ‘nec fera
caerulea domuit Germania pube' (‘ ber blue·eyed sons ’); stava Ceres, 1, 1, 15 ¹
n, etc. For Neptune’s blue eyes cp. Cicero, N. D. 1, 30, 83, ‘non pudet
igitur physicum, id est speculatorem venatoremque naturae, ab animis con-
suetudine imbutis petere testimonium veritatis? isto enim modo licebit
Iovem semper barbatum, Apollinem semper imberbem, caesios oculos
Minervae, caeruleos esse Neptuni!

47-48. The dives amator comes ready made to the clegy from the New
comedy and is a leading figure in each. His model was the mercenary
soldiers with which the Macedonian period was crowded, ‘typical soldiers of
fortune, with their coarse love of sensual pleasure—their coarse contempt of
everything that cannot be caten, drunk, or handled’ (Gildersleeve, Introd.
Persius, p. 20). Famous literary examples arethe Thraso of Terence and
the Pyrgopolinices of Plautus. See Introd. p. 45. For the topic of the dives
amator see, eg. 1, 8, 29; 1, 9, 53; 2, 3, 59; Propert. 4, 5; Ovid, Amor. 1, 8,
23; 3, 8; and often. For his faithful agent the lena, 1, 4, 59 (but see n. ad
loc.); 1, 9, 51; 2, 6, 443 Propert. and Ovid, l.c.,· etc.

47. haec: plural because, although the construction changes aster amator,
the poet is thinking of the lena as well as of the dives amator. - nocuere:

49-56. The formal cursing of the lena (a favourite theme also of the
comedy, one too which appears occasionally in actual devotiones discovered
from tirne to time) isa regular section of this topic, cp. 1, 4, 593 2, 6, 433
Propert. 4, 5, 65; Ovid, Amor. 1, 8, 1133 etc. But the black bitterness of this
passage and the awfulness of the scene suggested is rarely approached else· ,
where in Roman poetry. ’
