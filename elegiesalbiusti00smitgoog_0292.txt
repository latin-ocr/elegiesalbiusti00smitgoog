NOTES [1‚ 4, 75

whose behalf Priapos (as he was told) was being consulted falls to the
ground, first, because Titius,th0ugh not especially uncommon, is never used
in this way, second, if Titius were used in this way the passage on poets
61-76, traditional in this connection, could only mean either that Tibullus
(intentionally or uuintentionally) forgot the dramatic situation and put his
own feelings in the words of Priapos, or else that Priapos had recognized the
‘blind’ at once and had proceeded with the real patient accordingly. This
is all impossible because it would anticipate and therefore quite spoil the best
effect of the piece, the surprise in the last four lines. Hiibner (cp. too
Broukhus. ad loc.) identifies Titius with the young poet who was a friend of
Horace (Epist. 1, 3, 9) and who went to Asia with Tiberius in ao rac. This
is probably correct. At all events he ought to be a poet and also a poet at
least fairly well known. To make this clear let us assume for the moment
the attitude of a contemporary reading this poem for the first time. ‘How is
it, Priapos, that in spite of your disadvantages you are so successful in love l’
(1-6). ls the poet simply in search of general information or has he a per·
sonal motive? Decision suspended until, ‘Boys, honour the poets,' etc.
(61 f.). Ah, Tib. was evidently aslring for himself. No (73-74); the poet
was Titius, not Tibullus. Thus suspicion is allayed until 81, which brings the
surprise arrd also allows the poet to show naturally and artistically that this
poem belongs to the group concerned with Marathus.

73. quaa canerem: ae. in response to astatement to Priapos made to that
effect by the poet, but which for artistic reasons is suggested here instead of
being mentioned in the introductory address (aoy-edidit ore: returns
for the moment to elevated diction. edere is used of oracles and solemn
utterances, and ore with verbs of saying is epic (orer a score of exx. occur in
the Aeneid alone).

74. A traditional motive in this sphere, cp. Meleager, Anah. Pal. 5, 208,
and Ovid, Ars Amat. 2, 682. Abuse of the bridegroom at his wedding was
regular and ceremonial (to avert the evil eye). He was regularly accused of
the tastes ascribed to him in 73, cp. Catuli. 61, 126 fi.; Pliny, 8, 1803 Quintil.

been just married.

topic. ‘Titius does not need this information after all. Thanks however
