As it was designed to be read, 'not sung, the Roman elegy was
more highly rhetorical and details os form were more carefully
considered than would otherwise have been necessary. The dis·
tich in particular, as we find it in the poems os Tibullus and his
successors, represents the greatest triumph os Roman genius in
the domain of verse technique, and maychallenge comparison with
the best work os the Greek masters. Every detail of rhetoric and
style is wrought out with the utmost delicacy and care. The
theme, as we· shall see, is developed ina typical sashion, and as
compared with the epigram the distich is constructed with greater
attention, and the language is more fastidious. Herein we have
a definite, clear distinction between the Roman elegy and the
Roman epigram in distichs.

But while the language of the elegy as opposed to that os the
epigram is always poetical, nevertheless it caret‘ully avoids as a rule
the more elevated mood os epic and tragedy. This law is in
harmony with the ars celare artem, the apparent absence of any·
thing like artifice, the effect of unstudied ease and naturalness, sor
which the elegy is especially distinguished. The ideal is dainti·
ness and grace rather than sublimity or the soaring moods and
aspirations os high poetry. The author repeatedly informs us that
his verse is of the lighter sort, mere ‘nugae’ or ‘opuscula’ and
though he sometimes forgets and tells the truth, he generally as·
sures us that he has no ambitions‚ that his poems are only meant
to win his lady-love, and that is they fail in this object they may all
go hang. Strange to say, modern scholars have often taken him
at his word.¹ ¹

These general lawS, these standard rules and representative
tendencies ol the Roman elegy as a whole, are most fully and
clearly illustrated by Albius Tibullus. To him in fact belongs the
distinction of having given artistic perfectiori to the department on
Roman ground.
