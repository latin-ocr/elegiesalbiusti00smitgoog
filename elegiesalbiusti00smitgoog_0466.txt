NOTES [2, 5, 55

the legend was that Mars came down from heaven in full armou13 cp. Juv. 11,
10'73 Claud. Cons. Proh. 99, both of which passages describe representations of
this scene in art. In surviving objects of art he is generally represented with
shield, helmet, and lance (Friedtsnder, Juv. 11, 103-107, and ref.).

55-56. Having now reached the foundation of Rome, the climax of her
prophecy and the final fruition of Aeneas’s long toil and suffering, the Sibyl is
skilfully made to spare details by referring to, and then reaching, the idyllic
picture of 23-38. She then, herself, adds as a climax where it belongs (57-
62) that completion of the picture which the poet himself would have corne
to in a moment if he had not (apparently) been interrupted by her at 39 f.

55. septem montibus: Varro, De Lingua Latina, 5, 7, 41 (written in the
time of Cicero), says that the old name of the present site of Rome was
Septimontium-‘ubi nunc est Roma, Septimontium nominatum ab tot
montibus quos postea urbs muris comprehendit'—and proceeds to discuss
the names of the different ‘montes' This appears to be the earliest reference
in Roman literature to the ‘Seven Hills' of Rome as such. There was, how-
ever, au old festival known as the Septimontium which lasted until far down
into the Empire, and the association oi it with di indigetes (or a dem ἐπάξας)
carries the idea back to at least as early as the Second Punic War, rie. to the
time when the pontifices ceased from making gods of this type. See R. Peter
in Roscher’s Lexikon, 2, 222, 46 ff, and Goetz and Schoell's edit. (Leipzig,
1910) of Varro, L. L. 6, 24 and the ref. in n. ad loc, also Wissowa, Ges. Abhandl.
a. ram. Relt'g. und Stadtgesch. 1904, p. 240 n. Literary reference to Rome as
the ‘City of the Seven Hills’ first becomes prominent in the Augustan poets.
Tibullus is preceded a few years by Verg. G. 2, 5 34 (cp. Α. 6, 783) -

scilicet et rerum facta est pulcherrima Roma,
septemque nna sibi muro circumdedit arces,

and also by Propert. 3, 11, 57 -

septem urbs alta iugis toto quae praesidet orbi.

Two years after our poet's death we have Hor. Carm. Saec. 7—

dis quibus septem placuere colles,
and twenty years later, ovid, Trist. 1, 5, 69 -

sed quae de septem totum circumspicit orbem
montibus, imperii Roma deumque locus.
