NOTES [1, 3, 57

57-66. What was said above (35-48 n.) oi the Golden Age may also be
said of Elysium. Elysii Campi, Ἠλύσιον πεδίον (Hom. Odyss. 4, 563), the
‘lsles os the Blest’ (Hesiod, W. ancil). 166; Plutarch, Mor. 565 F; Lulrian,
Vera Hist. 2, 5, eto), the ‘Garden ol the Hesperides,’ where the Suo sets

(EuripHippol. 7423 Mimnermos, frag. 11 Crus. etc.); the ‘Mountain ol the ·

Gods’ (Hom. Odyss. 6, 43, the Aeolian and Ionian version ?); the 'Garrlen ol
the Gods' (Sopholrles, frag. 297 N. etc.; the Dorian version ?); the ‘Gardeu
ol' Phoibos’ (Stesich. frag. 6Crus.; Soph. frag. 870 N.; Eurip. frag. 771, etc),
-these are all different names which to a certain extent record varying tradi·
tions, but they all mean the same thing-the ‘land ol those who have gone
hence! Nor is its location any more definite than its name (cp. Servius on
Verg. A. 5, 7355 Verg. A. 6, 8877 Lucan, 9, 1ο; eto). Usually however itis
beyond the Ocean Stream where the sun sets, and always at the end oi the
world. As a rule one reaches it by the gates ol death, but in the speculatione
olthe lollr there is no impassable bertier between our lile and the lile oi those
beyond the grave. Odysseus had returned alive from Hades, and it is a well··
known historical lact that the gallant Sertorius was at one time actually on
the eve of setting sall lor the Fortunate lsles in the Western Ocean, just as
many centuries later, Ponce de Leon took the same direction in his search lor
the Fountain ol Youth. Notable passages in this connection besides those
already cited are Pindar‚ olymp. 2, 623 frag.129-130B.; [Plato] Axioch.
371 Ο, Luhian, De Luct.2(p. 923); Verg. A. 6, 5403 638; Val. Flaccus, 1, ’
835; CarnaEpig. 11093 1186; Aristothan. 1543 449, cp. n. on 45—46
above. For a sample ol the numerous passages dealing with this theme in
mediaeval and modern authors cp. Ariosto‚ 6, 73.

Here, as in his episode ot' the Golden Age, Tib. has studied simplicity and
there are no traces ol a definite model. He probably thought oi his Elysium
as ‘in medio Inlerorum’ but a definite statement is impossible. Echoes
os him here are Ovid, Amor. 3, 9, 59, and perhaps the epigram (p. 173 below)
ol Dom. Marsus. Among more modern echoes cp. Bau, ‘Amours de Meline,’
(Euvres‚1emene, Paris, 1881, vol. 1, p. 72, ‘Dans les champs Elysiens Ι Sont
les amants anciens‚’ etc.

57-58. Mantuanus, Eclog. 3, 108 (ed. Mustard, Baltimore, 1911, p. 75) -

sive ad lelices vadam post lunera campesi

Cp. also Marcantonio Flaminio, Carm. 3, 1 (echoing ovid, Le.) -

ah liceat saltem Elysios invisere campos
et fortunatae regna beata plagae,

hic uhi cum molli Nemesis formosa Tibullo
ludit, et est vati Lesbia iuncta suo.
