The characteristic vices os the Hellenistic elegy are suggested
by what has already been said of the period itself. They were
overmuch complication in structure, an excess os antiquarianism,

Lucian and Alciphr0n‚ who used comedy directly, and in Aristaenetus and Philo-
stratus¹ who did not know comedy directly but drew on Lucian and Alciphron or
on Alexandrian elegy. ln single cases the Roman elegists may have been in·
fluenced directly by the νέα, ior they knew the plays, but the indirect relation is
the only natural one and is indicated by the diffusiori ol these motives in Greek
and Roman erotic literature and hythe close connection between Greek and
Roman elegy as shown by the erotic epigram.¹

lt will be seen that Leo did not entirely exclude the νέα as a direct influenee.
lt was lett ior his followers (notably Heelner) to narrow his view and to make the
Alexandrian elegy ‘the clearing house lor all Greek influence on Roman elegy.'
This of course is most unlikely. Much better was Gollnisch, who extended [seo's
theory so iar as to show that the Romans were influenced directlyby the epi·
gram, comedy, and mythologicalelegy, as well as by the assumed Alexandrian
prototypa. Reitzenstein's most valuable contributions te this discussion have been
the emphasis he bas given to rhetoric, especially rhetorical τόποι as constructive
agencies, and to the laet that so lar as the Greeks were concemed there was no hard
and last line between the elegy and the elegiae epigram. Jacoby's theory is in
briei that the starting point and chief source oi the Roman elegy is the Alexan·
drian erotic epigram, but that we should also consider, though in less degree, the
comedy, the mythological elegy, and the bucolic. Emphasis on these points is
timely‚ and the results are oi great value. lsolated cases (see Jacoby, l.c. p. 81)
oi probably direct derivation from these sources have already been pointed out. We
cannot derive the Roman subjective erotic elegy as a whole from a single source.
Indeed irrespective of the testimony of the elegies themselves the theory of a
single source is rendered unlikely by the eclecticism so notably characteristic oi
the Augustan poete. Finally, as noted by Jacoby and as more clearly and pre-
cisely stated by Wheeler¹ within the department itsels the comparative prominence
oi one or another oi these sources above the rest appears to vary with the period
as well as with the individual. The importance oi comedy as a direct source
seems to increase with time: bucolic (whether direct or indirect it is impossible to
say) is most prominent in Tibullus, the mythological tradition in Propertius,
comedy and formal rhetoric in Ovid.

Tne weakness oi Jacoby, it seems to me, is the fact that he tries to prove too
much. He assumes that the Alexandrian erotic epigram is the starting point and
chief source oi the Roman elegy. This may be true, but it is yet to be proved, and
l cannot see how it will ever be proved by the method which hc himself has used
in his last article, ‘Tibulls erste Elegie, ein Beitrag zum Verstandniss der Tibulli·
schen Kunst‚' Rhein. Mus. 64, 601 s. and 65. aa l.

llaving made this assumption, Jacoby must either prove it from the Roman ,
elegy itself, which no one can do, or else protect it by annihilating the assumed
Alexandrian type oi subjective erotic elegy (cp. his own nalve statement in Rhein.
Mus. 60, 57, n. 1). Pohlenz's discussion of Philetas (see p. 19. n. ι, above) cannot
be ignored by those who agree with Jacoby.
