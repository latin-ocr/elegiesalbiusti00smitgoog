dinner, furtim to the fact that Delia must escape frorn home unobserved in

order to attend it.—deducet: here again asin 66 the poor lover takes the
place of a slave.

66. vincla: the sandala were regularly removed at dinner, cp. Plato, Symp.
21313; Hor. Sat. 2, 8, 7,, Epist. r, 13, 15, Mart. 3, 50, 3.

67. emimus frustra: proverbial, cp. Livy, 40, 8, ιο, Paroem. Graeci,
Zenob. 1, 72, etc-verbis victa: the alliteration is perhaps intentional.
See 1, ιο, 65 n.-patenclt: a favourite word with Vergil. Tibullus's useof
inceptives is sparing: outside the ordinary verbs we have only candesco, t, ιο,
43, succresco, 1, 7, 55. ·

68. Α common (and brutal, cp. Introd. p. 5ο) variation of 60. Cp. 2, 4,
31-34n.-pleua manu: cp. r, 9, 52, Hom. Odyss. ro, 42; rr, 359; etc.
The meaning is clear, but perhaps there is also a play on the proverbial
plena manu = ‘abundantly' ‘generously’ (cp. percutienda).-percutienda:

69-76. These lines, 1, 9, 63-72, and motives from Propertius are echoed in
Bertin, Amours, 2, 6, ‘ll un rival!

⁶⁹·70· ‘What goes up must come down,’ cp. 1, 2, 87, 1, 5, 5-6 n. Another
application of the law of Nemesis which is the favourite text of all antiquity.
Philosophers, moralists, poeta, rhetoricians, dwell upon it, the Wheel of For·
tune is a pictorial embodiment of it, even tbe guests at a dinner find it a con-
genial topic (Petron. 55), but few have the courage of Vagellius in Seneca
(N. Q. 6, 2, 9) who said, ‘si cadendum est mihi e caelo cecidisse velim!

69. ponor is often used, as here, of a successful rival in love, Hor. od. 3,
9, 2, Sat. 2, 5, 76, Terence, Phorm. 533. Tibullus never uses rivalis, cp.
r, 6, 21 n.

70. The Wheel of Fortune was evidently a familiar conception in Cicero’s
time, butIn Pison. 22 is the earliest reference to it. ,Artistie representations,
a number of which have survived, are all later. Literary references hegin
to be plentiful from the time of the elegiae poets (Propert. 2, 8, 8, ovid,
Trist. 5, 8, 7, Pone. 2, 3, 56, 4, 3, 313 Hor. Od. 3, ιο, ιο, Seneca, Agant.

Goth. 632: Boeth. Cons. Phil. 2, 1 and 2, etc.) and become extremely frequent
in the Middle Agcs and the Renaissance. Representations were common in
the time of the Antonines (Fronto, 157 N.) and the symbolism had already
attached itself also to Nemesis and Tyche. It is probably not much older
than the third century uc. and may have been suggested by the earlier Ball
of F ortune. The Ball of Fortune, which bas the same symbolism and was also
frequentin art, has been carried back to Lysippos's famous picture of Kairos
(ss described by Kallistratos, 6). But reference to it is largely confined to
