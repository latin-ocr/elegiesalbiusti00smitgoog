describes the sky as any one will realize who has watched the Loire 01 a
summer's day shisting and shimmering from moment to moment according
to the colour of the medium it reflecte· Il water is to be caerula, ‘ sky colour‚’
it must have no colour oi its own, te. it must be clear; and as a matter oi
fact the loire under ordinary circumstances, and still more the Cydnus (see
below), is almost as clear as a mountain brook iu Vermont. This and the asso-
ciations of lympha suggest that caerula here and caeruleus below connote
something like ‘clear’ or ‘sparkling’ rather than ‘blue.' As a sample osa
somewhat different point ol' view, cp. Martin Opitz, Schbserie von der Nymphen
Hercinie (1630), ‘darm wirst du samt den Fltissen Ι Der gelben Loir’ Angiers
und Tours und Blois begrdssen! (Is this a confused echo of the Tibullian
line, aie. did Opitz associate flavi with Liger instead 01 Carmitisl). Our
interpretation of caerula is supported by the poet Guy de Tours (1562-1611)
who lived all his lise within sight oi the river, cp. his Souspirs‚ 2, 28-

13-14. The surcharge ol epithets, all emphasizing the calm stillness oi the
Cydnus, is not common and has caused much discussion (esp. as regards
placidis aquis). See, however, 2, 1, 803 Propert. 1 11, 11, ‘aut teneat
clausam tenui Teuthrantis in unda Ι alternae facilis cedere lympha manu';
Hor. Od. 1, 31, 7, ⁴ non rura quae Liris quieta Ι mordet aqua taciturnus amnis ’3
Livy, 29, 25, 93 Ovid, Trist. 3,10, 30, ‘caeruleos ventis latices durantibus
Hister Ι congelat et tectis in mare serpit aquis! Wilson and Hogarth (En-
cyclop. Bria, mh edit. 2, p. 758) say that ‘The Cydnus (Tersous or Tarsus
Chai) is formed by the junctior of three streams that rise in Mt. Tarsus (Bul-
gar Dagb), and one of them flows through the narrow gorge known as the
Cilician Gates. Alter passing Tarsus, the river enters a marsh which occupies
the site oi the ancient harbour. 1110 Cydnus is liable to floods, and its de·
posits have covered Roman Tarsus to a depth ot' 20 feet! Bunbury (Emp-
clop. Brit, roth edit. av. Cydnus) says that it is a ‘rapid river? The epithet
describes admirably the upper course of the stream, but it does not apply to
the lower portion, which Tibullus and antique writers in general seem to have
had in mind. Tarsus stands upon a plain. Small boats can still be used sor
