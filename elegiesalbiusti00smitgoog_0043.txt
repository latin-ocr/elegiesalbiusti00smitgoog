TIBVLLVS

careless or unappreciative of his patron. On the contrary it
would be difficult to name another great writer so entirely de·
voted to the interests oi a single family. If from the sum total
os his surviving works we subtract his more or less literary
love affairs and the single poem addressed to Macer (2, 6),
the remainder, so sar as it can be connected with any one at all,
is concerned either with Messalla or with his honsehold.

This absorption is the more striking if we remind ourselves

that the period in question-in round numbers, from 30 to 20
rac—was the acme of the Augustan Age, and a decade which
for its contributions to the abiding literature oi the· world can
only be compared with the days of Perikles or Elizabeth.
The state was equally rich in men of rare distinction in other
walks os lise, and it may be assumed that Tibullus was per-

sonally acquainted with the majority os his famous contem· ·

poraries But we should never suspect it from his own works
He mentions no one, not even Horace, and with Horace, we may
be sure, he was on terms of considerable intimacy.

Recent criticism has been inclined to emphasize the view that
the poet’s silence was prompted by political opposition to the im·
perial government. The view derives some apparent support from
the fact that as a descendant of the small gentry of Latium Tibullus
would naturallybe a republican, and, as Marx has pointed out,
that his attitude toward Cassius os Parma asa literary model (Hor.
Epist. 1, 4, 3) may indicate political sympathy with that last survi-
vor (V eil. 2, 87, 3) of the assassins os Julius. The explanation how·
ever is not so plausible as it appears at first sight. If the poet’s
silence was in any sense due to politice, why is he equally silent
regarding all his predecessore, both Greek and Roman? Why is it
that his longest and most ambitious elegy (a, 5) is in honour of
the new regime? Moreover he had already proved his loyalty
by actual service in the field, here as elsewhere repeating the ·
attitude, certainly os Messalla, and probably oi Messalla's circle.
The real literary centre os the opposition was not Messalla, but
