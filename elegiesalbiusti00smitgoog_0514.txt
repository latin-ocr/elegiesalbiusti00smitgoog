treat on her birthday. The complete details of the situation are not given
and are no longer available. But the foremost idea in her own mind is clear
enough. Cerinthus will not be there, and the girlish keenness of her disap-
pointment is reflected in every epithet. ‘My hateful old birtlrday,’ she says,
‘is coming, and the dreary hours of it must be passed in the stupid country

of the name in address where we should expect the pronoun of the first or
second person is esp. characteristic of lovers and children. It is emphatic or
dramatic‚ often pathetic, tender, or appealing. The most notable among the
Greek poets for its use isTheolrritos‚ cp. 1, 1033 1353 5,9; 15; 193 7,55;
96; ιο, 38, cp. also Hom. ΙΙ. 1, 240; Odysr. 9, 369. No one employa it so
frequently as Catullus with whom it often gives the effect of a survival from
the natvete of his childhood, cp. 8, 1, 'miser Catulle, desinas ineptire ’ς 8, 12,

3-4. See 2, 3, 64-67. The reason for the point of view, however, is suffi-
ciently evident in both passages. Line 4 shows that the country place of
Messalla to which S.is referring was not far from the picturesque old hill

town of Arretium (Arezzo) in Etruria. The amnis is the Arno which rises in '

the Apennines (Monte Falturna) near Arezzo, flows S. E. through the valley
of Carentino until it reaches Arezzo, where it turns to the N. W.

these epithets is to be taken seriously. · ¹

5. nimium . . . studiose: ‘quite too solicitous for me‚’ i.e. over-anxious
to be doing something for me. The amusing side of the situation for the
onloolrer is that Messalla's special effort to please his niece is evidently coupled
with a blissful ignorance of the importance of Corinthus in her scheme of life.
Of course the attention was well meant. For that very reason it was all the
more irritating. Hence Sulpicia's impatient 'iam quiescas,’ ‘now do be still,'
a colloquial use of the word frequent, e.g.‚ in Plautus (Most. 1173; etc.) but
not found elsewhere in the elegy. -mei studiose: 1, 8, 3 n.
