quite as characteristic of her youth, her sex, aud her essential
innocence. Having once given herself, she rej0iced in the

The identity os Cerinthus is a mystery. We may however dis-
card at once the statement that he was ‘a young Greek' ol ‘ob
scure birth! Irrespective oi the literary associatious os the name,
the reversed conditions os the elegy so careiully observed by the
poet of the first group are prool enough that it was a pseudonym.
Further the mere fact that Cerinthus is Greek favours the assump-
tion that the real name was Roman. The assertion that he was
oi humble birth is certainly not proved by 4, ro, 6, the passage
stom which it is derived, and is rendered most unlikely, not only
by the poet’s attitude toward him and by the fact that in the
Augustan Age hunting (4, 3), in which the poet makes him engage,
was distinctly a gentleman's pursuit, but also and above all be·
cause os his evidently intimate relations with the household of
Messalla. Equally grouudless is the assertion based upon 4, 6,
15-16‚ that the girl’s mother considered him an undesirable parti.
She simply had never thought of him at all in that connection.
Any other interpretation spoils the desired coutrast between lines
15 aud 16.

The older Italian scholars (cp. the reading os 2, 2, 9, and 2, 3,
¹.) and some modern investigators (ag. K. P. Schulze) do not
hesitate to identily Cerinthus with Cornutus, the newly married
young friend to whom Tibullus addressed 2, 3, and in honour ol
whose birthday he wrote 2, 2. If this is true, it is impossible not
to identily the ‘uxor’ os 2, 2, 11 with Sulpicia, and to see in this
charming poem the epilogue os her romance. One is sorely
tempted to believe it, the more so as we really have no evidence

against it. The circumstances and surroundings os Cerinthus and
Cornutus appear to have been identical ; the two names are metri·
cally equivalent3 above all it is hard to believe there were two
young men in the circle of Messalla at the same time so exactly
alike temperamentally as the shy and wordless, but sorely smitten,
