550, suggests that he may have hadl a direct knowledge os Tibul-
lus, but the evidence is slight and not especially convincing (see 1,
2, 19-20 and note).

Here at last the tiny rivulet of Tibullian tradition finally dries
up. There are no citations from himin Priscian, and hencesorth
until the Renaissance, is we exclude three or four mediaeval book
catalogues, all evidence of him is confined to the occasional quota-
tion of a passage which may always be traced either to one of the
mediaeval florilegia (see p. 89) or to a note of some ancient
grammarian or commentator.1 ι

With the Revival ol Learning our poet, together with Catullus
and Propertius, once more came to the front, and sor the time
being resumed his place in the territory over which Ovid had so
long reigned alone. Delia again becomes a familiarcharacte13 the
literary gossip of Apuleius and Sidonius is revived and enlarged.
Genuine literary echoes begin near the end of the fourteenth
century and until the sixteenth century occur with some frequeuey
in the poetry ol the Humanists (Joannes Secundus, Sannazaro,
Baptista Mantuanus,² Aleandro, Pontanus, etc). Since then
Latin verse has reverted more or less to the manner and form os
ovid.

The number ol editions issued before 1700 is a good prool that
Tibullus must have been fairly well known to the more cultivated
reading public throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries'.
It must be confessed however that there are no very striking proofs
oi it in the vernacular literature os that period. In England for
example the tradition has always been slender. 'Jonson's Pectuster
numbers Tibullus among its dramatis personae3 Daniel's choice of
Delia as the title oi a collection ol amatory sonnets (1592) is an
early example os an allusion which since then has appeared again
’ and again; occasionally Tibullus iumishes the tagof Latin regularly
