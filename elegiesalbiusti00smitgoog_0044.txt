INTRODUCTION

Pollio. Finally, why should we expect to find references to con· .
temporaries or references to great authors past or present in that
idyllic erotic type of elegy of which Tibullus is the only surviving
example?

But irrespective of the reasons already given the circumstances of
Tibullus himself, and still more tbe essential character of the circle
in which he moved, are quite enough to explain his attitude toward Ι
the contemporary world. Horace and Maecenas, Tibullus and
Messalla, each pair was an ideal example of the relation between
poet and patron. But Horace, both by nature, training, and ne-
cessity, was a man of wide acquaintance and manifold interests.
Tibullus was not. Like Horace he was intensely loyal toa few old
and tried friends; but owing to his wealth, his temperament, and
his surroundings he was not driven to enlarge his sphere by necessity ’
nor led to it by inclination. In this respect the altitude of each
reflects to a certain extent the point of view of the circle to which
he belonged. The circle of Messalla was unconventional, refined,
delightful. But it was uuofficial ; it was not directly concerned
with national matters. Poetry was cultivated purely for its own
sake, and Messalla himself was revered and loved for his personal
qualities and as the head of a great patrician house, not as the
representative of national policies, not as the 'very impersonation
so to spealr of the great present aud the greater future of Rome.
It was not therefore that Tibullus and his friends loved Caesar
Augustus less, but that they loved Messalla Corvinus so very much
more.

Rivalry there may have been toa certain extent. Valgius, ,s
highly praised by his contemporaries, might be called the Vergil
of the Messalla circle. The ten elegies of Tibullus's first book,
manifestly bucolic in their tradition and tendency, have been com-
pared with the ten eclogues of Vergil 3 the elegy dealing with
Priapus (1, 4), with Horace’s satire (1, 8) on the same subject.
Tbe situation however is sufficiently explained by the common
phenomenon ofa contemporary interest in certain themes and
