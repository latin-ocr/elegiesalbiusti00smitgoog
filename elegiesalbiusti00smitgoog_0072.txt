pean literature merely ior the single century from 1550 to 1650
probably exceeds the sum oi that exerted by both his rivals during
the entire nineteen centuries since their death.

Propertius is unique. In his personality as wellas in his art he
is a fascinating puzzle oi apparent paradoxes and inconsistencies.
An elegiae poet by nature and choice, he nevertheless disregards

· practically every convention of the department. In an atmosphere

os hall-ironical sentiment and cultivated persiliage he istor the
most part passionately serious and desperately sincere. In ade-
partment the ideal of which is clarity and unstudied ease he is a
proverb of abruptness, irregularity, startling contrane, and ob·
scurity. Few Roman poets are so charged with literary rem-
iniscence. No Roman poet is more strikingly original. He did
not, hay, he could not, think as others have thought. His emo-
tional insight, his bizarre and powersul imagination, strain at the
leash oi the distich, and tax every resource oi his native tongue.
A lover oi pleasure, yet with high ideals‚ arapid thinker, but a slow
and painful composer, a cool head, but an ardent heart, always
young in years, yet, matured early as he was in the fierce sun ol an
absorbing passion, never young in spirit, Propertius has imparted to
his poetry-if we may borrow from the most penetrating and
sympathetic of his modern crities—‘ a touch of harshness, the
suspicion as it were ol a bitter after-taste, reminding one of fruit
that has ripened without sunlight, os hearts that have loved without
happiness.’¹ He is, and we should expect him to be, the favourite
in the cultivated world oi today. His temperament and attitude
have much in common with the mood of the present generation;
his abruptness, his tendency to exaggeration, his startling contrastS,
his very neglect oi the conventional canons oi classical style, in
themselves commend him to readers accustomed to the ‘high re-
' lief’ oi modern literary art. Not however th'at Propertius will
ever be known and admired by a large circle os readers. He is
lar too difficolt. But no one with the intelligence and training to
