On this group ol poema (7-12), the work of Sulpicia herself, see Introd. p.
79. The arrangement is editorial, and, as usual, is based on variety rather than
chronology, otherwise this poem would have been the last instead ol the first of

the series. All are in the epistolary form, although this one reads more like an J
extract as it were from her own diary and was ostensibly written just aster the J

consummation os her love, t'or she is still in a highly exalted mood. She has y
yet to be assailed hythe alterthoughts inevitable in such an allair. These are l
touched upon by the poet ol the first group (2-6), cp. 4, 5, 6-14‚ who, as we ¹

have seen, adds some further details aud alludes to later stages. Assuming

that these poems are the record of a genuine love affair, Sulpicia belongs to a ¹

type certain to be variously judged, not only by her contemporaries, but by her
readers. Dissen,a commentator ol unusual sympathy and insight, says of

this poem, and 1 should prefer to agree with him: ‘Sulpicia experta furtim l

oscula et amplexus Cerinthi nonhabet turpe quod passa erat, utpote puri
castique amoris sibi conscia, ceteroquin magna in affectu secum loquens nec·
dum ad sedatiorem statum anirni reversa. ac poeta exhibet virginem magni

animi, puris sensibus, at in summo ardore puellari! Less sentiment or more ,
knowledge ol the world, or both, might incline one rather to agree with Mar· ι

chaste, puris sensibus, qui s'exalte pour un baiser lurtif l lleyne tui-meme
n’est pas si nats? A third critic might be cruel enough to reconcile, the Gaul
and the Teuton by remarking that sincerity does not necessarily irnply con-
stancy, and that ol all coquettes there is none so dangerous and destructive
as the one who is absolutely in earnest —at the time. Ol course still another
solution isquite possible. We might suggest that these verses are'not the record
,of agenuine allair,but merelyaseries os literary exercises written, it is true, by
Sulpicia, but merely the record, let us say, ol her own contribution to a theme
proposed and worked upon in concert in the inner circle ol Messalla's poetical
friends. In that case the question would settle itsell by ceasing to exist.
