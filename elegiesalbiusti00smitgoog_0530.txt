not proved, it is a later imitation, we might agree with him that 4, 13, 14 is a
‘weak variant’ or rather a weaker variant of 1, 5, 4ο.

15. For the oath see 4, 5, 73 4, 6, 1 and notes. iuro with two accusatives
(Verg. A. 6, 3243 Cicero, Fam. 7, 12, 2, etc.) is found only here in the Ti·‘
bullian corpus, never in Propertius, never in Ovid (so Burman's Index).

17-18. Ovid, Ars Amat. 3, 486, ‘pignora nec puero credite vestra novo';
Her. 21, 204, 'ei mihi, quod seusus sum tibi fassa meos!

17. cedo: ale. ‘give up) The transitive use of cedo occasional in prose
and comedy is very rare in poetry—only Lucret. 5, 986; Manil. 2, 5853
Seneca, Herc. Oet. 1282, Lucan, 3, 423 (Thes).

18. proderat ista timor ι ‘that fear of yours was of velue to me,’ i.e. the
fear that he might be unfaithful to her; he calls it his pignora because it
constitutes his hold upon her. He has confessed that her fear was ground·
less, hence pignora cedo. The poet refers to an old rule of procedure in a
love affair which we find echoed eg. in Propert. 2, 14, 19, ‘hoc sensi prodesse
magis: contemnite amantes,’ etc. Cressida says (Troilus and Cress. 3, 2)- ·
‘I was won, my lord, Ι with the first glauce that ever—pardou me- Ι lf l
confess much, you will play the tyrant. Ι . . . See, we fools! Ι why havel
blabb’d? Who shall be true to us, Ι when vve are so unsecret to ourselves ?'

21. Professor Postgate finds that (he adopts Miiller's facias for faciam)
the ‘resemblance to Propertius, 1, 15, 30-32 is considerable: ‘annus et in·

quodcumque voles, nou aliena tamen!

²³· The slave’s refuge, cp. 2, 6, 33-34 n.; Eurip. Suppl. 2673 Livy, 27,
17,13.

24. Cp. 1, 8, 6; Hor. od. 3, 26, 115 Nonnos,4, 177.

In this epigram the author would be spared the knowledge of the infidel-
ities of his mistress.
Ovid, Amor. 3, 14, has developed the theme into an elegy. See also Luigi
Alamanni, Elegia a Flora—

Spesso mi e detto (ο dura aspra novella
Ben sorde volentier le orecchie avrel)
Florae men casta assai che vaga e bella.

Taci omai, vulgo, che parlar non dei
'Di donna, a cui bellezza e leggiadrla
Dieron si larghi al suo venir gli Dei¹ etc.
