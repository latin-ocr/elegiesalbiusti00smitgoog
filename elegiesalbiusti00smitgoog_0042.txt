INTRODUCTION

those who, like Tibullus, have been set down as belonging more
particularly to Messalla‘s group, the most distinguished were

s Valgius Rufus (4, 1, 181) and Aemilius Macer (a, 6, Int.), both ,s
famous poets‚ but now known tous only at second hand, or
through a few slight fragments. Lygdamus, Sulpicia, aud the
anonymous author of the Panegyricus Messallae (4, r) are known ,s
to us only from the Corpus Tr'bulltanum itself. Probably the
youthful Vergil should also be included, and certainly Ovid,
although his acquaintance with Messalla did not begin until aster
the death of our poet (see esp. Ullman, A.J. P. 33, 162).

The position of Messalla in· this circle was one'ldr which he
was well fitted from every point 'of view. A Roman gentleman
ol the highest and best type, and fastidious in all things, he
was sane and sensible, and possessed the unconventional ease
of assured position and os more than sixteen generations of
gentle blood. He was also a keen though kindly critic whose
standards os taste had been moulded by a stem discipline in
the domain ol language and style. Quintilian ior example
(10, 5, 2) tells us that, like Cicero, Crassus, and· the elder
generation os pleaders, Messalla, simply to train himself in the
resources os his own tongue, had made written translations ol
speech aiter speech os the Greek orators. He also wrote a
number of technical treatises on various questions os grammar
and style-‘ quosdam totos libellos,'as Quintilian says (1, 7, 35),
‘non verbis modo singulis sed etiam litteris dedit'-and we
are told by the Elder Seneca (Cant. a, 4, 8) that he was
‘exactissimi ingenii in omnes studiorum partes, Latini utique
sermonis observator diligentissimus?

Such was the critic and friend to whom Tibullus undoubtedly
read all his poetry, and the character and quality ol it as it
now stands suggest that the function and intluence of that
critic were iar more important than is acknowledged by the
poet, or seems to have *been generally recognized by his modern
readers It is not implied os course that he was in any ,way
