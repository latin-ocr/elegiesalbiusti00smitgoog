final result an emasculated‚ monotonous sweetness which helped
to make the Ovidian elegy a finished product in both sensas ol
the word. Doubtless we should feel less regret ii we could pro·
nounce Latin as Ovid did, sor that this law is associated in some
way with the accentual system ol Latin as opposed to Greek rnay
fairly be assumed. It may also be assumed that agreement oi
word accent and verse ictus was as desirable here as in the cadence
os the hexameter. But in that case we need oxytones, and
in the ordinary pronunciation of Ovid’s time there were no
oxytones.

Zielinski¹ however has shown that both poetry and oratorical
prose were not-and owing to conservatism, never had been-
pronounced according to the familiar rules os accentuation in the
time oi Cicero and Augustus, but that on the contrary they retain
and echo the pronunciatiou ol the time ol Plautus, when they first
reached artistic prominence. At all events ‘forent' represents the
required accentuation ol all iambic words at the close of a
Ciceronian clausula, and here perhaps we have the real explanation
os the law ol the dissyllable at the close ol the pentameter.

Il both halves contain dactyls only and close withan iambic word
the result is a uniform cadence lor both. The pre·Alexandrian
elegy made no eliort to avoid this combination, but in the
surviving pentameters of Kallimachos it is very rare. Catullus
was not especially influenced hythe norm of Kallimachos, but in
Tibullus the presence os only four such lines (1, 4, 4; 1, 5, 64;
2, a, 223 a, 5, 18) seems to indicate deliberate avoidance. The
same is true of Ovid, but to a less degree. Many ol his examples
however as, cg„ Amores, 3, 3, 8-
