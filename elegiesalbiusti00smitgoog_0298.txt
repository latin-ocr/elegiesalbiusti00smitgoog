NOTES [r, 5, 12

Amor. 3, 8, 23, etc.), ille qualifies the noun in apposition. Here, however,
ilicis the attributive of ego or in apposition with it; ‘that l,’ ‘that self of
other days) No exact parallel for this is found in Propertius, and Burman’s
Index quotes none from Ovid. For ille with a vocative, 2, 3, 743 2, 4, 2. -
cum . . . iaceres: cum circumstantial with the imperf. subj. as here occurs in
1,2,14; 651 1, 3, 9; 1, 4, 33; 1, 5, 391 1, ιο, 161 2, 5, 211 1112,3,5 cum
nearly = if. With the pluperf. l. 12 below. In 1, 3, 15 cum is perhaps con·
cesara-referas: an excellent description of the malarial troubles from
which the Romans suffered so much and which the poet has in mind 1 cp. 4, '
4, 103 4, 11, 21 Ovid, Ars Amat. Lc. 315 above; Hor. Carm. Sacc. 641 etc.

10. votis: general. The particulars follow in 11-16. Under such circum·
stances vota were usual aud, indeed, quite en rbgle on the part of one’s friends.
Hence, in this motive of the elegy they are never lacking3 cp. 4, 4; Ovid,
Ars Amat. l.c.; Amor. 2, 13, 231 Propert. 2, 9, 251 2, 28, 43 and 59, and we
usually hear of thamin connection with the will hunters; cp. Juv. 12, 95, etc.

11-12. This ceremony, which combines magic with the uscos practical dis·
inlectants, rests primarily ou the primitive theory of disease as a demon to be
exorcised. The two main details of the ceremony of lustration are mentioned
here. For fuller descriptions, cp. Nemes. 4, 62, ‘quid prodest quod me pagani
mater Amyntae Ι 111 vittis, ter fronde sacra, ter ture vaporo, l incendens vivo
crepitantes sulphure lauros, Ι lustravit cineresque aversa effudit iu amnem’;
Claudiam, VI Cous. Honor. 324, ‘lustralem tum rite facem, cui lumen
odorum Ι sulphure caeruleo nigroque bitumine fumat, l circum membra rotat
doctus purganda sacerdos Ι rore pio spargens, 11 dira fugantibus herbis Ι numina
purificumque Iovem Triviamque precatus 1 trans caput aversis manibus iacu-
latur in Austrum Ι secum rapturas cantata piacula taedas ’1 Pind. Pyrr. 3, 511
Propert. 4, 8, 83, etc. .

Both the Greeks and the Romans ascribed great healing and purifying
powers to sulphur, hence its regular use in lustration from the earliest times3
cp. Homer, Odyss. 22, 481; Il. 16, 2181 Theokrit. 24, 94; Propert. 4, 8, 86;
Ovid, Rem. Amor. 260, ‘nulla recantatas deponent pectora curas l nec fugiet
vivo sulfure victus amor '; Pliny, H. N. 35, 177, etc. See Ο. Gruppe, Griech.
Mythologr'e, Munich, 1906, p. 889, n. 4 with references.

12. praecinuisset: i.e. she uttered the incantation as she paced about the
siclr bed aud Tibullus followed with the sulphur. The word does not neces·
arily imply that she acted as a praecantatrix, ae. that Tib. repeated the
charm after her. In Ovid, Ars Amat. 2, 329-330 above, she is apparently
unaided and, in fact, ipse here (=‘in person’; cp. 1, 1, 7n.) twice repeated
emphasizes his special devotion, since this fonction was regularly performed
by the saga who was apt to call upon the girl’s lover to furnish the materials.
