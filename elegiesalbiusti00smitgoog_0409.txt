Robert and Knaacls, Hermes, 19, 480 and 341, suggest, the former, ‘dux peco-
ris: vites roserat ille novas,’ the latter, ‘dux pecoris vites hauserat hircus
olens.’ Both these emendations are suggested by the hauserat of V, and are
due to the theory that Tibullus was thinking here of the reason why goats were
sacrificed to Bacchus, ‘quia, ut ait Varro, vitem depascunt’ (see Diomedes,
quoted in 51-58n.). This reason, which seems to have often been men·
tioned in Tibullus’s time,is traced by Maass to the Erigone of Eratosthenes (see
Hygin. Astronom. 2, 43 Verg. G. 2, 3763 Anile. Pal. 9, 99). The emendation
would be more satisfactory if we knew whether the hauserat of V really goes
back to Tibullus or is merely a guess suggested by the hauserat of A, or,

finally, was itself due to some unknown predecessor of Robert, Kneack and
Maass in the interpretation of this line. See Schulze, Beitrdge, 11, p. 20 f.

59-60. The mention of prm here is probably meant to suggest the well·
known significance of the Lares for the entire slave population. The Lares,
in distinction from Vesta and the Penates, extended their protection to the

entire household, ie. to the firmilia in its widest sense 7which included the l

slaves. The' Lares were the most important figures in the old Roman religion.
Their worship embodied and supported the unity and integrity of home life

and the household.
On ilowers as an offering to the Lares see eg. Juv.9,138; 12, 873 Pliny,

21, 113 Plaut. Trin. 393 esp. Cato, De Agri Cult. 143, who tells us that ἵ

upon the day set apart for that purpose (cp. 1, 3, 34 n.) it was the duty
of the vilica (a slave) to crown the Lar Familiaris and pray to him for the
prosperity of the family.

⁶1-66. It was to country folk that Minerva first taught her arts. Here
woman first undertook her own peculiar tasks of spinning (63-64) and weav-
ine (⁶⁵⁴⁶). ἱ

63-64. This method ol spinning with the distaff (colus) andspindle (from) κ
was universal in antiquity. It isstill common in Greece and Southern Italy
and lasted even in Great Britain until the present generation. The locus
classicus is Catullus, 64, 312, cp. also 1, 6, 78 above, and Claudian, In Eutrop.
2, 381. The distafi with the mass of wool at the top was held in the left
hand. The right band was held palm uppermost and the fingers gradually
shaped the libres which the twirling of the spindle formed into thread. The
spindle was set in motion by the thumb of the right hand turned downwards.
This is Tibullus’s ‘ fusus et apposito pollice versat opus‚’ cp. also ovid, Her. 19,
