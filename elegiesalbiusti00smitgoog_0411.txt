whether he be found i' the tields Ι 'Mong beasts (where some think he was
born, and as Ι He grew up practised shooting upon them) Ι Or else,’ etc.
67-68. Pervig. Ven. 76, ‘rura secundat voluptas, rura Venerem sentiunt: Ι
ipse Amor puer Dionae rure natus dicitur, Ι hunc ager curn parturiret, ipsa
suscepit sinu, Ι ipsa florum delicatis educavit osculis¹ (cp. Plato, Symp. 196 A).
⁶7. agros armenta: ‘flocksand fields,’ cp. r, ro, 65 n.; Stat. Theb. 5, 334.
⁶8. indomitas equas: 2, 4, 57; Verg. G. 3, 266.
69-72. Τὴε power oi love over the animal creation was a favourite theme
with the poets and the philosophers‚ cp. eg. Soph. 85 5, 9 N.-

εἰσέρχεται μὲν ἰχθύων πλωτῷ γένει,
χέρσου δ’ ἔνεστιν ἐν τετρασκελεῖ γονῇ ·
νωμᾷ δ’ ἐν οἰωνοῖσι τούκείνης πτερόν,
ἐν θηρσίν, ἐν βροτοῖσιν, ἐν θεοῖς ἅνω.

So also Annia 7855 Eurip. Happel. ¹²7²³ Lucret. r,19; Verg. G. 3, 242,
Anti. Pal. 5, ιο. ·

The graceful, half-humorous, hali-sentimental turn which Tibullus gives to
this old theme strongly suggests the atmosphere of the Alexandrian idyll or
epigram at their best. Cupid first practised on the small garne about him.
But, like every other born hunter, the ambition fot larger game kept pace
with his increasing skill. It is thus that the once unsophisticated country boy
has become the redoubtable archer who spares no living thing, and never
misses his aim; cp. esp. Seneca, Phaedra, 277-357.

70. ‘Great eupid,1Archer of archers both in men and women'(Chap-
man) ς ‘Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim' (Shak.) ; Seneca, Phaedra,
277, ‘iste lascivus puer et renidens Ι tela quam certo moderatur arcu'; Mele-
ager, Anti. Pal. 16, 213, etc—ille: the frequency oi pronouns, esp. ot'
personal and demonstrative pronouns, is characteristic oi the elegy in general
andos Tibullus in particular. ego occurs 43 times, tu, 393 vos, 83 nos, 3.
The demonstrative pronouns pre also lively and dramatic, and are especially
needed in the type os sentence development commended by the emotional
attitude oi the poet and the construction os the distich. ille occurs not less
than roo times, hic, 87; iste, 53 ἐν, but 43 r'pse, 35. The derived adverbs
are also common.

71-72. Alkaios, Anti. Pal. 5, 10—

, Ἐχθαίρω τὸνἚρωτα· rt ’γὰρ βαρὺς οὐκ ἐπὶ θῆρας
ὄρνυται, ἀλλ’ ἐπ’ ἐμὴν ἱοβολεΐν κραδίηνῑ
