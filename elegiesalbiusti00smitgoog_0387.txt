Age (1, 1, 71 n.)‚ and os Retribution (r, 9, 4 n.)‚ are proverbial. The
ancients had a very keen perception ol these relentless figures, dogging our
sootsteps unseen, unheard, unsuspected, and, when they finally reach us,
always a surprise.

35-38. This is the Hades which recurs again and again in the classical
poets from Homer down, the ,abode os duat and shadow, the place οἱ Death
worse than Death himself, cp. Seneca, Herc. Fur. 697-

ΑΜΡΗ. Estne aliqua tellus Cereris aut Bacchi ferax?
Tuus. Non prata viridi laeta facie germinant
nec adulta leni fluctuat Zephyro seges;
nou ulla ramos silva pomiferos habet:
sterilis profundi vastitas squalet soli
et foeda tellus torpet aeterno situ . . .
immotus aer haeret et pigro sedet
nox atra mundo: cuncta maerore horrida
ipsaque Morte peior est Mortis locus.

So too Milton, P. L, 2, 618-

Through many a dark and· dreary vale

They passed, aud many a region dolorous,

O'er many a frozen, many a fiery Alp,

Rocks, caves, lakes, lens, bogs, dens, and shades ol death,
A universe ol death . . .

Where all life dies, death lives, aud Nature breeds,
Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,
Abominable, inutterable and worse

Titan lables yet have leigned, or sear conceived‚

Gorgona, and Hydras, and Chimaeras dire.

For Elysium and Tartarus, see 1, 3, 59 f. and notes.

35. aegea: 1, 3,=61 n.; Seneca, quoted above, etc-infra: natural
enough in this connection but extremely rare. 1 lind no other case. More
usual is ad or apud iny'eros, apud Orcum, and the like. - audax: found only .
here ol Kerberos but describes well the Dog ol Hades who recks ol naught,
cp. improbus applied to him by Propertius, 4, rr, 25. For Kerberos see 1, 3,
71 n.

3⁶· navita turpia: Charon, the boatman os the Styx, is post-Homeris:
(Eustath. 1666, 36). He appeared first in the epic Minyas and was after-
ward represented in the famous picture ol Hades by Polygnotos (cp. r, 3,
69·7o; 77·78; 79·8o, and notes) in the Lesche at Delphi (Pausan. 10,28, 2.).
He isa favourite ligure in the comedy and in Lukian (ag. Aristoph. Ran.
