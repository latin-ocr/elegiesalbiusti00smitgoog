TIBVLLVS

And line words iu the contre hid;
When cursed no stain'd uo maid's bliss,
And all discourse was summ'd in yes,

And uought forbad, but to forbid.

—amarunh the remaining exx. of syncopation in Tibullus are aptarim, ι,
6, 74; 4, 11, 4; portarit, 2, 5, 705 iurasset, 1, 4, 243 peccasse, 1, 6, 713 4, 7, 93
nudasse, 4, 7, 23 audissem, 1,10, 12; finissem, 2, 6, 193 nossem, ι, ro, 11 ;
petiere, 2, 3, 21; abiere, 2, 1, 433 redierunt, 2, 5, 37-a smaller number than
is usual in the dactylic poets of his time. On the other haud, unsyucopated
forms in the same sphere (tenses of the perfect stem in the fust aud to aless
extent in the fourth conjugatiou) are coufined to lassaverit, 1, 9, 553 liba·
verat, 1, 10, 213 fiirmaverat, 2, 5, 23. adiisse, 1, 2, 81, praeteriisse, 1, 4,
345 subiisse, 1, 4, 47 are usual iu dactylic verse. In other words, so far as
the first aud fourth conjugations are concerned Tibullus makes a surprisiugly
small use of those tenses and persons in which syncopatiou is usually per·
missible at will, but if he does use them he prefers the syncopated form.
The type, for instance, represented only by lassaverit, libaverat, aud formaverat
is much used by some poeta (esp. epic aud satiric) to fill out the fifth foot of
the hexameter. Ar the same time forms of verbs ending in a dactyl or readily
combining with the following word to form a dactyl are thoroughly appreci-
ated. These are especially common of course iu the second and third con·
jugatinus. Perfert infinitives, for example, of the type represented by incre·
’ puisse are obviously valuable esp. in the pentameter, but their frequency iu
Tibullus practically amouuts to a maunerism. ,76 cases iu books ¹1, 2, aud
