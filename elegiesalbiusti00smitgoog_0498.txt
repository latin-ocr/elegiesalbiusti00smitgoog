unharmed and unharming. Though l shall not be· there, yet think of me.
Better still, leave the hunters to go their way and come straight baclr to my
arms!

1-3. Of the animala which the Greeks and the Romans hunted for amuse-
ment, the boat was proverbially the most dangerous. Best description in

Xen. K yneget. 10, 1, f. Sulpicia asks the boar to have mercy on her young ,

lover. Her fear is intensitied by the unspolren but inevitable reflection that
in the case of Venus aud Adonis, the literary prototype of this situation, the
boar did not spare his beautiful victim, cp. Ovid, Met. 10, 705 f.; Propert. 2,
13, 535 Bion, 13 etc.

1—2. For similar poetical. references to the haunts of the boar see eg. Hor.
Sat. 2, 4, 403 od. 3, 12, 4; Ovid, Amor. 3, 10, 4o; Ars Amat. 1, 453 etc.
Xenophon, himself an experieuced bunter, says (Kyneget. 10, 6), more defr-
nitely that the trail of the boat generally takes the dogs into a thickly wooded
locality, ‘for the animal regularly has his testing place in such spots as they
are warm in winter and cool in summer;’ so Ovid, Met. 8, 334 (of the Caly·
donian boat), ‘concava vallis erat quo se demittere rivi Ι assuerant fluvialis
aquae: tenet ima lacunae Ι lenta salix ulvaeque leves iuncique palustres Ι vimi·
naque et longa parvae sub harundine cannae. Ι hinc aper excitus,’ etc.'

1. quis . . . colis: for the use of quis with a verb of the second person, 2,
3, 33, and 2, 3, 74 and notes.

a. devia montis: this construction (instead of devios montes) begins with
Lucretius and increases in the Augustan poets aad their successors, the poets
and the poetizing prose of the Silver Age (hence, common in Livy and Taci-
tus). lt occurs with tolerable frequency in Sallust, but never in Nepos, and
only occasionally in Cicero and Caesar (Schmalz).

3. nec sit acuisse: 1, 6, 3 and 24 with notes. The boar's habit of whet-
ting his tuslrs is osten mentioued, eg. Ovid, Met. 8, 369; Seneca, Phaed. 346.

5. Delia: it hardly seems necessary to assume (with Postgate) a lacuna be-
tween 4 and 5. The transition is suggested at once hythe traditional contrast
and opposition between Diana (Delia) and Venus (cura uenandi, and Amor),
cp. eg. Hor. od. 1, 1, 25, ‘manet sub love frigido Ι venator tenerae coniugis
immemor, Ι seu visa est catulis cerva fidelibus, Ι seu rupit teretes Marsus aper
plagas'; esp'. the story of Phaidra and Hippolytos. —curaz ablat. of means

‚with venandi.
Ἴ 6. canes: Xenophon, l.c., says that for hunting the wild boar oue should
have dogs of the Indiau, Cretan, Locrian, ancl Spartan breeds-‘and they
must be carefully selected in order that they may be ready to light the beast.’

7-8. The hunters with the aid of nets, etc, shut in (claudentem) the quarry
by forming a cordon (indagine). References to this process, which was of
