t, ι, 37] navarus

37-38. The invitation to the gods to be present and talre part is usual, and
in the age 61 saith was literally meant, 1, 7, 493 2, 2, 53 Verg. G. 1, 347; A.
5, 62: Ovid, Fast 6, 365, etc. That the gods do not scorn the gifts e paupere

mensa is the teaching 61 211 ages (Hor. Od. 3, 23; the ‘widow’s mite,’ etc.); ,
that they actually prefer them is an exaggeration more characteristic 61 modern ³

times.

37. divi: the 16116 12 archaia and poetic, 1,4, 35, 3,4, 5; 1, 8, 693 1, 9, 23
2, 5, 46 and 113; 4, 2, 5 and 6, 5. Similar archaic and poetic forms are deum,
2,5, 775 idem 161 iidem, 1, ro, 153 quis 161 quibus, 1, 2, 53 and 1, 6, 13.
These, however, are found in the poetry 61 211 periods. The temper 61 the
elegy does not allow any large usage 61 this sort3 see Introd. p. 29-1166
...11661 1,1,67n.

38. puris: 161 antiqnity cleanliness is not only next to godliness but (real
and ceremonial) 26 indispensable requisita 61 11; see 1, 3, 25 n.-flatillbus:
used 16 the early days (39-40) and retained in later times hy ceremonia!
conservatism. The locus classicus is Pliny, 35, 158, speaking 61 certain clay

figures ol the gods, ‘aurum enim et argentum ne diis quidem conficiebant. 1

durant etiam nunc plerisque in locis talia simulacra; fastigia quidem tern-
plornm etiam in urbe crebra et municipiis, mira caelatura et arte suique fir-
mitate, sanctiora auro, certe innocentiora. in sacris quidem etiam inter has
opes hodie non murrinis crystallinisve, sed fictilibus prolibatur simpnlis,’ etc.
So Ovid, Fast. 6, 316; Juv. 6, 342, etc. The phenornenon is characteristic 61
211 religions rites, especially 61 those from which the ideas and the point 61
view 61 magio are descended. Hence, eg, the ceremonial and magic signifi-
cance 61 bronze, 61 2111111 ax 161 certain sacrifices, etc.

For the law 611116 lambio dissyllable at the close 61 the pentameter, see
Introd. p. 98. According to Postgate’s figures (Hultgren’s are incorrect),
Tibullus has 27 exceptions in 1, 61010, 18 in 2, Wl„ 1 in 4, 2-6, 13⁰4„ 1 in
413, 84⁰l,; Sulpicia, 5⁰43 Catullus has 199, ⁶1r⁷r⁰l03 Propertius in 1, 128,
361010, but 16 4, only 6, 110101 Ovid has practically none except an occasional
example in the poems 61 the exile. Tr'isyllahles are 12 16 blr. 1, 9 16 blr. 2,
quadrisyllables are 13 in blr. 1, 9 in bk. 2, pentasyllables are 2 (1, 4, 84; 1, 2,
42). Next to the dissyllable the quadrisyllahle is on the whole preferred
(Catuli. 953 Propert. 87 in blr. 1).

39. fictilia: 161 the anaphora see 23 n. above. For a specific typevvith t

connectives, see 1, 1, 78 and note; 161 anaphora with change 61 ictus, 1, 8,
13 2611 note, 16 combination with cyclus vera, 2, 4, 51; uror, 4, 5, 5; optare,
4, 5, 17, in combination, as here, with 2 species 61 epanastrophe; unda, 3,
5, 15 laurus, 2, 5, 117; Ovid, Met. 6, 376, ‘quamvis sint sub aqua, sub aqua
maledicere temptant,’ etc. Most common in the poets is the device, as here,
