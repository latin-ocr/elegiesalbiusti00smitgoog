Horace. Lucret. 5, 123, indigna videri, is the first ex. acc. to Schmalz.
The first adjectives sd used were naturally verbal in their signif, as doctus,
scitus, nescius, etc. The cons. begins in prose with Val. Max. botis always
very rare. The remaining exx. in Tibullus are doctus, l. 28; 1, 9, 37; dig·
nus, 2, 6, 43; 4, 6, 10 (see note), but 3 times (35, 63, and 97) in the Pan.
Messallae alone; nescius, 1, 8, 72. Ptopertius uses doctus thus only in 2, 3,
wanda 5, 5·

For ‘credere ratem ventis,’ cp. eg. Anrh. Lat. 268 R, ‘credo ratem ventis,
animum ne crede puellis,’ ‘I’ll trust my ship toa storrn, my substance to a
broken citizen, before I'll credit any ol¹ you' (Shaclterley Marmion, The
Antiquary).

21. For this expressive way oi describing the heat and dtyness ol Italian
midsummer, cp. eg. Ovid, Amor. 2, 16, 33 Met. 3, 1523 Verg. G. , 2, 353; Α.
3, ι4ι ; Hor. Sat. 2, 5, 39, etc.

aa. fertilis is active, cp. 1, 1, 8, u.—llilus: the Nile begins to rise
about the middle ol June and continues to overllow until the beginning of
October'. As every one knows, Egypt, being an absolutely rainless country
(cp. 25-26), would be a mere desert without it.

23-24. The mystery of the source, which involved the mystery ol the flood
—finally discovered in our own time by David Livingstone-was discussed
again and again in antiquity. Herod. 2, 19 is the most famous and the best
worth reading. Roman interest in the matter rested largely on the prolonged
discussions os the Alexandrian Greeks, cp. the long-winded episode of Lucan,
10,193-331; Seneca, N. Q.4,1; 6, 8 3 etc.; Pliny, 5, 51 ; Claudian, Nilus ;
Thomson’s Seasom, ‘Summer,’ 773, etc. For the antique discussion, see esp.
H. Diels, Abhand. d. Berlin. Akademie, 1885, pp. 1-54. lt is quite possible
that Kallimachos dealt with the theme in his epyllion, the Io, and if so that
it may have reappeared in the Io os Calvus, see note on 28 below.

25. te propter: propter is confined to this phrase in Tibullus, cp. 1, 6, 57
and 65 ; 2, 6, 35. Propertius, 4, 7, 25, me propter, otherwise regularly, 2, 8,
35³ 9‚25; 3. 19219·

26. This line is quoted by Seneca, N. Q. 4, 2, 2 and attributed to Ovid, the
only passage of Tibullus quoted by any antique author except the grammarians,
see Introd. pp. 59-60.-pluvio Iovi: the epithet is rare. The only remaining
exx. of it in the entire literature (none occur in the inscriptions) are Stat. T heb.
4, 757, ‘nil humile est; tu nunc ventis pluvioque rogaris Ι pro Iove’ 3 Auta.
Lat. 395, 46 R, ‘annua sulcatae coniecti semina terrae Ι pascit hiems: Pluvio
de Iove cuncta madent’ (this carmen de mensibus was originally copied from
astone kalendarium probably ol the fourth century. Each month is accom-
panied bya tetrastich. The two lines just quoted belong to the month ol
