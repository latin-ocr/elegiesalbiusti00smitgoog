in his own house' although that too was sometimes claimed even in antiquity,
cp. Anti. Pal. 10, 55, 111 πάνυ κομπάζῃς προστάγμασι μὴ ὑπακούειν Ι τῆς
γαμετῆς, ληρεῖν οὐ γὰρ ἀπὸ δρυὸς 01, Ι οὐδ’ ἀπὸ πέτρης, 010, Plautus, Cas. 815
(comic epithal), ‘sensim super attolle limen pedes, nova nupta, Ι sospes iter

incipe hoc, nti viro tuo Ι semper sis superstes, Ι tuaque nt potior pollentia sit ’

vincasque virum victrixque sies Ι tua vox saperet tuomque imperinm: vir te
vestiat, virum despolies,' etc-suae: 1, 5, 42 0.-001011111121 ie. ‘resort to,’
‘throng about‚’ cp. 1, 3, 33, 1, 6, 17, 101 celeber see 2, 1, 3311.

76. male habet: ‘vexes’ ’1111120202ι The expression, which is not found
elsewhere in the elegy, was perhaps conversational, cp. Terence, And. 436
‘hoc male habet virum'; 940; Hec. 606, Ρ12111.Α12“1ι.844, Caes. B. C. 1,63.
Cp. note on bella, 1, 9, 71.

77. gloria cuiquem est: sounds proverbial. Similar expressions are
Plaut. Stich. 693, ‘suom quoique decet’3 Quintil. 10, 2, 22, ‘suus cuique
decor est,' etc. The whole passage isos course satirical.

Synaloephe 01 est in Tib. is the general rule (50 011101 86). 111 the first
arsis 1, ς, 46, otherwise always in the thesis. The masculine caesura 01 the
hexameter (13 cases) or the end 01 the first hemistich in the pentameter
(9 cases) ispreserred: then at the end 01 the verse (hex. 9, pent. 4), at the
second thesis (hex. 4, pent. 2) and finally 21 the fourth thesis 10 cases, all in
the hexameter. Synaloephe 01 es occurs 1, 9, 53 and 77 (2 cases 011101 6)
both in the hexameter. Synaloephe 01 these forms is therefore much less
common in the pentameter (17 cases) than in the hexameter (39). The
vowels involved are a, 27 cases, i, 8; um, 6; e, 4, 0, 4; u, 1 (1, 6, 45).-
spernentur: a lover’s word, 1, 8, 553 Ovid, Amor. 3, 6, 65, Her. 4, 168,
Propert. 2, 18, 7, etc.

78. The line intentionally suggests the iuris consultus whose clienta call
upon him 101 advice, a typical illustration in philosophical discussion, hence
common in rhetoric and satire, Hor. Sat. 1, 1, 9, ‘agricolam laudat iuris
legumque peritus Ι sub galli cantum consultor ubi ostia pulsat'; Ovid, Amor,
1, 13, 21, ‘nec 111 consulto, nec 111 incunda diserto: Ι cogitur ad lites surgere
uterque novas'3 Cicero, Mur. 22. Tibullus is now, soto speak‚ an artioris
consultus ready 10 give advice to clients.

79-80. The previous distich had suggested to his mind the picture 01 the

great teacher 11111 01 years and well-earned renown, escorted wherever he goes
by an admiring throng 01 young men listening with reuerent attention to his
. golden words on the subject 01 - how 10 sncceed in an intrigue. The satire
01 course lies in the contrast between the assumed importance 01 the teacher
and the real insignificance of his theme.

79. tempus erit, cum: very solemn , the poet is rapt, as it were, by the
