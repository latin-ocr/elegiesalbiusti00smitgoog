NOTES [1, 3, 49

κατασκήψῃ ἡ ipra, Aristot. De Animal. Hirr. 5, 22, 4; ‘sive ille est caeli sudor
[cp. German Himmelschweiss=honey] sive quaedam siderum saliva, sive pnr-
gantis se aeris sucus,’ Pliny, H. N, 11, 303 etc.). lt is thence precipitated in
the morning dew (⁴ idemque [ie. Celsus] ait, ex floribus ceras fieri, ex
matutino rore mella: Columella, 9, 14, 20, etc), and shows an especial sond-
ness for settling on the leaves 01 the 0211 (Τ1110111121101,)913ν. 18, ‘De Melle:
etc.). In No Man's Land, and, as here, 11 the Golden Age it was so abun·
dant that it dripped from the leaves (Verg. E. 4, 303 Ovid, Met. 1, 1123
Aetna, 13, etc.). But nowadays the honey is neither as abundant noras
good (Pliny, 11, 31), and we must wait until the bees gather it ior us from
the oaks (or, if we adopt Trimalchio's theory [Petron. 56]‚ ‘mel vomunt,
etiamsi dicuntur illud a love afferre,' a iollr legend corresponding to the
Finnish idea that the bees fly up to midheaven and bring down honey 11011
the storehouse oi the gods), cp. also 2, 1, 49-50 1.

46. securis: 1, 1‚8n.

47-48. Note the skiliul arrangement. The poet had gone to war and
was in danger of dying prematurely. This is the real theme 01 the elegy
which, lor the moment, we had iorgotten in our bright dream oi other days.
We are roused by the poet's intentionally emphatic statement that there was
no such thing as horrible war in the Golden Age. In this way we get a nat·
1121 and easy return to the realities 01 the present. For the topic oi warin
this connection, cp. 1, 3, 37-40; 1,10,7-1o,andnotes; Ovid, Met. 1, 973
Verg. G. 2, 539; Juv. 15, 168; etc.

47. acies: cp. 2, 3, 37; the word brings up the whole picture ot' a battle·
field, the pomp and circumstance as well as the toil and peril oi the opposing
hosts. Lucretius had already said, 21111 describing the miseries oi primaeval
man (5, 999), ‘at non multa viram snb signis 111112 ducta Ι una dies dabat
exitio,’ ie. wretched they may have been, but at least they were spared the
wholesale botchery oi 2 modern battlefield. -nec ensem, etc: 2121011111 way

49-50. lt is, 01 course, understood that the contrast between the age of
Saturn and the age oi Jove applies to every point in the description 01 36-48.
Β11 11 view 01 the poet’s present condition, it was quite sufficient and much
more artistic merely to mention those suggestive 01 premature death. Art
also demanded that he should reject, as he has done, the traditional succes·
sion oi four ages, and adopt that form 01 the tradition (as ag. in Vergil, G. 1,
121, cp. 11, 01 1111 41 above), which merely divided the history oi mankind
into Saturn’s Age, the desirable past, and into Jove's Age, the undesirable
