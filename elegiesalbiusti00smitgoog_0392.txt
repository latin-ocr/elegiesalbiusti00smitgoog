ment ol que (cp. 1, 1, 40 n.) is not as extreme as would appear at first sight.
-male sobrius: ‘anything but sober,’ iae. very drunk. male is often used
with things desirable in the sense of a polite but decided negative3 cp. eg.
malesanus, 'far from being in his right mind,’ the suggestion being that as a
matter of fact the man is stark, staring mad, nrale fidus, male gratus, etc.; so
we say, ‘I can ill allord,’ etc. male in this use betrays the personal equation
ol the speaker, it emphasizes the prominence or the desirability of the thing
negatived. On the other hand, male with things undesirable often acts asa
superlative; cp. male raucus, ‘dreadlnlly hoarse,’ me male odit, ‘he hates me
horribly,' male nretuo, ‘I arn much afraid! Compare our expression ‘to be
badly scaren: ‘badly hurt,’ and the like. For adverbs with adjectives as here,

Ter. Adel. 101, ‘non est flagitium, mihi crede, adulescentulum Ι scortari neque
potare: non est: ¹neque fores l ecfringere,' and often whenever a love allair
dla mode is mentioned. It is interesting, however, to observe that then, as
now, an indemnity sor such ⁸ nocturna bella’ was sometimes demanded in the
police court the next morning, cp. eg. Herondas, 2, 63, where the plaintill
one Battaros, a leno, addressing the jury, says —
