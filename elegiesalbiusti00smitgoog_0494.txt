NOTES

Nature her selle her shape admires,
The Gods are wounded in her sight,

And love lorsakes his heavenly lires,
And at her eyes his brand doth lighl;

Shakespeare, Sonnet 153 (first published in 1609) - Ἴ

But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
The boy lor trial needs would touch my breast;

Ben Jonson, Underwoods, ‘A Nymph’s Passion’ - ’

But he hath eyes so round and might,
As make away my doubt,
Where love may all his torches light
' Though hate had put them out.

See also Rowe's Ambilious Stepmother, Act 3, Scene 1, 'The God of Love
stands ready with his torch Ι To light it at thy eyes, but still in vain, Ι For ere
the flame can catch,’tis drown'd in tears’; Aphra Behn, Song (to Love),
⁶ From thy bright eyes he took his fires, Ι which round about in sport he hurl’d ’;
Guy de Toum, Pourtrait de son Ente, 3; Remy Belleau (Seconde Journe‘e de
la Bergerie), ⁴ qu'il prend des feux atdans de vos chastes prunelles, Ι Yeux,
ou naissent d’Amour les vives etincelles! Even in these days we find James
Branch Cabell saying (⁶The Awakening‚’ Smart Set, 12, 1904, p. 75), ‘ 1
= won't tell you, with Propertius, that her complexion reminded me of rosea
swimming in milk . . . nor am 1 going to insist, with Ovid, that her eyes had
a fite like that of stare, nor proclaim, with Tibullus, that Cupid was in the
habitos lighting his torch from them.’

Paulus silentiarius, Anth. Pal. 5, 260 -

ἸΚεκριίφαλοι σφίγγουσι τεὴν τρίχας τήκομαι οίστρῳ,
Ῥείης τυργοφόρον δείκελον εἰσορόων.

ἀοκετές ἐστι κάρηνονς ἐγὼ ξανθίσμαοι χαίτης
ἔκχυτον ἐκ στέρνων ἐξεσόβησα νόον,

ἀργενναῖς ὀθόνῃσι κατήορα βόστρυχα κεύθεις,
οὐδὲν ἐλαφροτέρη φλὸξ κατέχει κραδίην.

μορφὴν τριχθαδίην Χαρίτων τριὰς ἀμφιπολεύει· ’
τᾶσα δέ μοι μορφὴ τΰρ ίδιον προχέει.
