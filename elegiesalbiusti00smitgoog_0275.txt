emphasizing sharp contrasts by juxtaposition as here. In Ars Amat. r, 475,
Ovid makes the same point by another method, ‘quid magis est saxo durum,
quid mollius unda? Ι dura tamen molli saxa cavantur aqua.’

This ex. is frequently associated with the wearing away of rings and of the
ploughshare (Lucret. 1, 3133 Plutarch, Ι. c. ; Ovid, Ars Amat. 1, 4744 Pont.
2, 7, 4o; 4, 10, 5; Trist. 4, ό, 13), with the wearing of pavement by wbeels
(Lucret. and Plutarch, l.c.; Ovid, Pont. 2, 7, 40), and as here with the subJu·
gation of animals. The homeliness of these illustratione suggests that their
ultimate source lies in the sphere of philosophical discussion.

19. Cp. Verg. E. 9, 49, ‘duceret apricis in collibus uva colorem.’ In
Trist. 4, 6, 9 (cp. 17 n. above) after citing the example of the horse, the ox,
the lion, and the elephant, Ovid continues with this example and expande it
thus, ‘tempus ut extensis tumeat facit uva racemis Ι vixque merum capiant
grana quod intus habent3 Ι tempus et in canas semen producit aristas, Ι et
ne sint tristi poma sapore cavet,’ then compleres the list with, ‘hoc tenuat
dentem terram renovantis aratri, Ι hoc rigidas silices, hoc adamanta terit‚’
and thus finally leads up to his point with, ‘hoc etiam saevas paulatim miti·
gat iras, Ι hoc minuit luctus maestaque corda levat. Ι cuncta potest igitur tacito
pede lapsa vetustas Ι praeterquam curas attenuare meas)

ao. The movement of the heavenly bodies is not used elsewhere in this
connection. For the idea cp. Manilius, 1, 109, ‘attribuitque suas formas, sua
nomina signis, Ι quasque vices agerent certa sub sorte notavit!

21-26. ‘Swear and never flinch! Lovers’ oaths are not registered above
and therefore may be broken with impunity,’ cp. 4, 4, 15 n. end; Ovid, Amor.
1, 8, 85; esp. Ars Amat. 1, 631-658.

21. The lover’s oath (Appellatus ὅρκος, cp. Hesych. s.v.; Persem.
Graeci, 1, 441; 221; 3493 2, 320 and notes) that never reaches the ears of
the gods, the lover’s perjury borne away by the winds and seas, ale. that was
uttered to no purpose (cp. 1, 5, 35 n.; Meleag. Anth. Pol. 5, 8, 5, etc.) and
therefore will never return to plague its inventor,is one of the best-known
proverbs of antiquity. It appears first in Hesiod, cp. 23 and n. below. Other
ref. are Frag. Trag. Graec. Adesp. 525; Plato, Phileb. 65 C; Symp. 183 B;
Cornut. Theol. Graec. 24 ; Publil. Syr. 383 especially Kallimach. Auta. Pal. 5,
6, ὤμοσεν· ἀλλὰ λέγουσιν ἀληθέα τοὺς ἐν ἔρωτι Ι ὅρκους μὴ δύσειν οὔατ’ ἐς ἀθα-
νάτων, cp. Aristainet. 2, 20; Ovid, Amor. 2, 8, 193 Seneca Rhet. Controv. 2,
2; Propert. 2, 16, 473 Lygd. 3, 6, 49. Horace's ode to the flirt Barine (2, 8,
cp. esp. 1-16) is founded on this idea. Juvenal, 3, 145, applies it satirically
to the poor. All remember Juliet’s ‘ yet, if thou swear’st, Ι Thou mayst prove
false: at lovers’ perjuries, Ι They say, Jove laughs.’ -nec: 1, 1, 67 n.

aa. freta summa: Lucan, 3, 702, ‘summas remeabat in undas’
