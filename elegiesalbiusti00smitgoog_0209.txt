has offered her hair iu this way at the tomb oi Agamemnon. Helen, however,
was then old enough, perhaps, to have her reasons sor being conservative.

Tibullus would have Delia spare herbeauty‚cp. 1, 5, 43. The touch of
tendemess is characteristic os him-aud oi the elegy.

69-74. ‘Gather ye rosebuds while ye may i' The dominant note in the
music of Mimnermos which lingers in the elegy and finds a responsive echo in
the heart of age-and os the ages, cp. 1, 4, 27 f. and notes3 Propert. 2, 15,
233 Ovid, Ars Amat. 2, 669: Catullus, 53 Varro, Sat. Men. 87 B; Antln Pal.
5,11;etc.

69-70. Cp. Carducci, ‘A Neera' (juvenilia, 31) -

Enoi, Neera, il canto ’

De' morri udrem·; noi sederem tra· fiori
De l'asiodelo. Intanto

Mesciamo i dolci e fuggitivi amori.

69. iungamus amores: 4, 13, 23 Catuli. 64, 372; Ovid, Trisr. 2, 5363
etc., i.e. the plural amores here is reciprocal, ‘ lct us love each other,’ cp. ‘our
loves,' a savonrite phrase of the Elizabethan poeta, and the Ovidian iungere
oscula. For the plural of amores in another sense, 1, 3, 81 and note.

70. tenebris Mors adoperta caput: Ovid,Mer. 2, 790, describes Invidia
as ‘adoperta . . .’ nubibus atris’3 Verg. A. 6, 866, ‘se'd nox atra caput tristi
circumvolat umbra’ (cp. ornos. 20, 351), hut I find no complete parallel sor this
curiously impressive phrase. ‘Death that shroudeth his head in darkness' is
suggestive of some work os art or possibly, even, ol the stage tradition os

'Thanatos (as eg. in the Alkesta's). Perhaps the poet was thinking of the
-Homerie 'Arios κυνέη, the famous ‘Cap of Darkness’ which Hesiod, Scut.
227, describes as, νυκτὸς ζόφον αἰνὸν ἔχουσα. Cyllenius (Venice, 1487) ex·
plains as ‘anullo conspecta et a nemine intellecta! Death is unseen and
always a surprise, ep. Frag. Trag. Graec. Adesp. 127, aaron ἄφαντος
προσέβα Ι μακρὰς ἀφαιρούμενος ἐλπίδας Ι θνατῶν πολύμοχθος ‘Areae Like the
ghost oi Banquo in Machala, Death isinvisible sor all except the one to whom
hc comes, cp. eg. the Alkestis, 259 ff. Nor have 1 found any echo of this

Tibullian phrase in the modern languagcs. The Humanists, however, were im-
pressed by it. Mustard cites, eg, Fontanus, Amores, bk. 2 (‘ magica ad depel-
lendum amorem ’) —-

tuque nigram tenebris Nox adoperta comam.

Joannes Secundus usually echoes Catullus. No less, however, than three
times he comes back to this line, cp. his Funera, 1, 10-

Nox tenebris incincta capnt nigrantibus adsit.
