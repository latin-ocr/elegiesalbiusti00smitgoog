r, 3, r 5] TIBVLLVS

15. solator: the formation and use of agent nouns of this type is char·
acteristic o'f the Roman poets, especially of the epic poers of the first century
who furnish a number of rarities of this sort. Τὴε small number of them in
Tibullus is quite in harmony with the studied simplicity of his style. solator
is distinctly poetic and was doubtless rare, so also consitor (2, 3, 63), but
otherwise we lind only ortator, auctor, cultor, ianitor, pastor, praedator, tex·
trix, and νίκων- all in common use.

1⁶. iudas: active, cp. 1, 1, 8 n.- usque: 1, 2, 88 n.

17. aut: introduces the alternative of the preceding line, a'.e. ‘quaerebam
. . . moras;' aut‘ego sum causatus,' etc-causatus: for the shift from direct

statement (⁸ aves dant omina dira') to indirect statement (⁶ me tenuisse,' etc.) in
the next line, cp. 2, 5, 71-78, and notes. Not uncommon, for instance, in the

speeches of Livy (23, 45, 7; 26, 13, 33 26, 22, 8; 27, 40, 8, etc.).— avet:
omens good and bad from this source are constantly referred to, eg. Val.
Max. 1, 4, 2, ·Τί. Gracchus tribunatum adepturus pullarium domi con·
suluit ab eoque ire in campum prohibitus est. sed cum pertinaciter pergeret,
sic illisit mox extra ianuam pedem, ut eius excuteretur articulus (cp. 19-20
below). deinde tres corti prodeunti ei curn vocibus adversis involaverunt et
compugnantes tegulam ante pedes eius deiecerunt'; Theophrast. Characa 16
(28 Jebb); etc.

18. Saturni diam this happens to be the earliest literary reference now
surviving in Latin to the ancestor' of our modern name Saturday. On the
Greek side, however, we leam from Cassius Dio that this name for the Jewish
Sabbath had already been in use for 'some years. In 49, 22, 4, writing of the
year 36 B.C. he says, ἑάλωσαν μὲνγὰρ πρότεροι μὲν ol ὑπὲρ τοῦ τεμένους τοῦ
θεοῦ ἀμυνόμειυι, ἔπειτα δὲ raiol attor ἐν τῇ τοῦ Κρόνου καὶ τότε ἡμέρᾳ
ὠνομασμένη, cp. 37, 17, 3; 66, 7, 2 (Vespasian's capture of Jerusalem in 70
A.1).); Frontin. Strateg. 2, r, 17, ‘Divus Augustus Vespasianus Iudaeos
Saturni die, quo eis nefas est quicquam seriae rei agere adortus superavit!

Why the Jewish Sabbath was called Saturni dies was a matter of doubt to
the investigators of the first century, cp. Tacitus, Hisf. 5, 4, ‘septimo die otium
placuisse ferunt, quia is finem laborum tulerit; dein blandiente inertia sep-
timum quoque annum ignaviae datum. alii honorem eum Saturno haberi,
seu principia religionis tradentibus ldaeis quoscum Saturno pulsos et con·
ditores gentis accepimus, seu quod de septem sideribus quis mortales
reguntur, altissimo orbe et praecipua potentia stella Saturni feratur ac¹ plera-
que caelestium viam suam et cursus septenos per numeros compleant!

“ The Jews began to make themselves felt in Rome soon after the eastern
conquests of Pompey in 63 uc. By the time of Tibullus and Horace their
strict observance of the Sabbath as a <lay of rest was doubtless one of the
