TIBVLLVS

, elsewhere gently task his friend with being too much the slave of i
- his affectious. At least this is the literal meaning of Odcs, 1, 33, ³
in which he refers to the ‘woeful elegies' in which Tibullus ‘con-
. tinually harps ’ on the fact that ‘Glycera ' has deceived and slighted
him for ayouuger man. No one knows who Glycera was. It is
most reasonable to suppose however that she was either Nemesis
or, more likely, Delia. The term miserabiles elegi will apply to
either cycle. Ἴ

condition during the last five or ten years of his life. The elegiae
lover is always slight and delicate (see a, 3, 9, and note) ; heis
not fit' to endure exposure except when ordered to it by imperious
Love‚ and anything like manual lahour blisters his hands at once.
Nevertheless Tibullus's reference to his ‘tender hands' and
‘slender limbs' (a, 3, 9) is no doubt really descriptive of his per-
sonal appearance. At all events we naturally associate a slight
physique with a man of Tibullus's temperament.

So far as the question of his actual physical condition is con-
cerned, the elegies give no indication of the nervous excitability so
characteristic of Propertius. On the other hand we also fail to
find the. superabundant vitality, the rude health, of Ovid. Indeed
we have no right to expect it. Probably the vitality of Tibullus
was low, and his constitution delicate. Otherwise he would not
have died at the early age of 35. The health of such people may
be good enough from day to (lay, but they are often prone to
dwell somewhat upon the details of the matter.

That this was the case with Tibullus himself rs clearly indicated by
Horace's epistle to him ln this poem Horace begins by laying
special emphasis on the fact that his friend rs a veritable Fortuna-
tus. He has everything that heart could wish—wealth, good
sense, genius, fame‚a charming personality, good looks-amongst
the rest, good health (valetudo).

'This is not flattery. Itis encouragement‚ and as such the
natural prelude to the bit of advice and waming which as usual
