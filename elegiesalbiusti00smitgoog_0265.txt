that marriage is itself a τέλος, a sacrament, and that the Danaides being false
to their vows (‘Veneris quod numina laesit ³) were really ἄγαμοι, and there-
fore, ἀμύητοι. Moreover there was also a popular superstition that in Hades
the unmarried were condemned to carry water in sieves istil the bath was
filled which they should have talren (the bath was a regular detail of the mar-
riage ritual). A striking parallel is the well-known superstition of the Eliza·
bethan Age that old maida are destined to ‘lead apes in Hell’ After the
third century, Μ, references to this punishment of the Danaides are extremely
numerous ⁵

The reference to the Danaides, perjurers to love, serves as the transition to
81-82, and also points a moral for Delia which is applied in 83 ff. So Hor.
od. 3, 11, 24, ends his description of Hades with the Danaides and then says,
‘audiat Lyde scelus atque notas Ι virginum poenas et inane lymphae Ι dolium
fundo pereuntis imo Ι seraque fata Ι quae manent culpas etiam sub Orco!

81-82. Such a man is unfaithful to love and therefore furnishes the neces·
sary contrast to his innocent victim, the faithful lover of 57-58. The gods
themselves declara that such sinners shall not be forgotten, says Tibullus in
another one of his favourite parables for the edification of Delia (1, 6, 45-54);
cp. 1, 9, 4 and 19 addressed to Marathus. The therne is well worn in the
elegy; cp. 1, 8, 705 1, 2, 87-88 and notes.

81. Calpurnius, 3, 88, ‘ilice, quae nostros primum violavit amores,’ seems
to be an echo of this line-violavit: ale. sinned against, desecrated (1, 6, 51).
Love and the lover ate sacrosanct; cp. 1, 2, 27-28n.-amores: plural be·
cause reciprocated, cp. 1, 9, 13 1, 1, 69 n. Or amores may mean the loved
one, cp. 1, 6, 35 n. Either meaning will suit the context.

82. optavit: asse. ‘perhaps this is why Ι went on this unfortunate expedi· ¹

tion' The real force of optavit here is derived from the universal maxim of
follr philosophy that a wish or a curse, being a manifestation of the will

and addressed to the gods, has a tendency to worlr automatically, cp. Ovid, ¹
Met. 13, 483 Hor. Sat. 2, 7, 363 Cicero, Prov. Cons. ²3 Mart: 8, 613 Taci·
tus, Hist. 1, 84, and-often. Hence if one repents of one’s hasty word one ¹
withdraws it, or takes the consequences of it upon one’s self, cp. 1, 2, 12n.; ’
1, 6, 85; etc. Couched in the proper words and accompanied by the requisite ’

formalities, such a curse becomes a devotio and is irresistible.

83-92. A genre picture in the poet’s happiest vein and one of the best ¹

portrayals of a situation which as a whole or in part is a favourite motive of
classieal literature, Terence, Heaut. 275 (aster Menander), but esp. the
story of Lucretia as told by Livy, 1, 57, 7, and Ovid, Fasti, 2, 725f See also ¹

Propertius, 4, 3, 33-423 3, 6, 153 1, 3, 4¹3 etc.
Delia is to be spending her evening in the traditional and approved manner
