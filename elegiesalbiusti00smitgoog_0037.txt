TIBVLLVS

(484, 17, K) agrammarian of the fourth century, the vita, and the
mss. Otherwise the poet’s own rule of the simple cognomen
‘Tibullus’ (1, 3, 553 1, 9, 83; 4, 13, 13) is followed invariably.
His praenomen has not survived.

The cognomen of Tibullus seems to be unique in the surviving
record of Roman nomenclature, and it cannot be shown that any
one of the handful of more or less obscure Albii now known to us
was even a distant connection of the poet. The vita however
says that he was a Roman knight, the class from which the literary
genius of Rome was at all periods so largely reeruited‚ and he
himself informs us (1, 1, 19 ff. and 41 ff.) that his forbears were
rich landed proprietors, but that a large part of the property had
been lost. It is possible that as in the case of Vergil, Propertius,
and other contemporaries, the reverses to which he alludes were
occasioned hythe famous confiscation of lands which Octavianus
was forced to make for the benefit of his veterans after Philippi in
42 ae. There were however other confiscations of the same sort
in 36 and in 31, and as the poet himself suggests neither a cause
nora date for the' family misfortunes it seems useless to pursue the
subject further.

But whatever the earlier losses may have been, we leam from
the poet himself that his income though modest (cp. note on
paupertas, 1, 1, 5, and the following lines) was quite enough to
supplyall his wants, r, r, 77-8-'

ego composito securus acervo
despiciam dites despiciamque famem.

On the other hand Horace (Epist. 1, 4, 7) says of him

di tibi divitias dederunt,

and those who maintain that the Albius to whom Horace refers is
not our Albius see in this statement a-striking proof of their
theory. The definition of wealth however is largely a relative, 'not
to say a subjective, matter. It should be observed· too that
