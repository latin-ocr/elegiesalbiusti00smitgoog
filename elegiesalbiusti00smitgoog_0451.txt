2, 5, 1] TIBVLLVS

the¹ prophecy of the Sibyl (39 f.)‚ and the thought that'the prodigies attending

the death of Caesar are all a thing of the past leads naturally to the favourite
idyllic picture of 81. This brings us by an easy transition to Nemesis and
his own elegiae sorrows, then back to Messalinus again, and thus the poem
ends as usual on the keynote. See Introd. p. 92.

1. sacerdos: i.e. Messalinus, now one of the X er'ri.

2-1o. lt has been pointed out that this description (cp. 7-8; Ovid, Met.
11, 165) indicates the famous Apollo Kitharoidos of Skopas, which Augustus
had recently placed in the temple on the Palatine. Propertius says after see·
ing it there (2, 31, 5), ⁴ hic equidem Phoebo visus mihi pulchrior ipso Ι mar-
moreus tacita carmen hiare lyra! The Apollo Musagetes now in the Vatican
is probably an imitation of it.

Apollo is invoked not only as the kitkaroidos, the singer and the patron of

. poets, but as the god to whom the triumph at Actium (5 a.) was due, aud

finally as the god of prophecy (11 f.).

2. age: so 2, 2, ro.-cithara carminibusque: 1, ιο, 65 n.

3. Imitated in Carm. Epig. 489, 3 Β, ‘vox ei grata fuit, pulsabat pollice
cordas.’-nune . ..nuner 1, 8, 75 u.-pollice: of playing the cithara,

Ι 0vid, Met. 5, 339, Amor. 2, 4, 27, and often.

4. precor: rare with the accus. aud infin, cp. Ovid, Her. 5,158, 19, 82,
Pont. 1, 7, 6; Val. Flacc. 7, 35 3, Pliny, 18,131. This appears to be the first
case-flectere: 1, 7, 37 11. For ad laudes cp. 1, 7, 38 n.

5. triumphali lauro: 1, 7, 5-8 n. The laurel crown on the Apollo of
Skopas was evidently meant to suggest the song of triumph after the fight
with the Titans to which Tibullus himself alludes in 9-10. The fight with
the Titans is throughout the divine prototypa and analogy of the fight with
the Lords of Misrule at Actium. When, therefore, the Apollo of Skopas be-
carne the Apollo of the Palatine, the laurel crown symbolized the triumph at
Actium as well as its Olympian prototype. -temporar 1, 1, 70 11.

6. cumulant aras: generally completed with some such ablative as donis,
cp. Verg. A. 8, 284, 11, 5ο, 12, 215, etc. The indefinite subject ‘they’ is
found only here in Tibullus and is extremely uncommon ia classical Latin
except with verbs of saying, thinking. and calling.

7. sed: ‘yes, and . . .' This use of sed, in which the adversative force
has nearly disappeared, belongs to the language of conversation, but is found
in all types of composition, cp. eg. 2, 4, 3, Martial, 1, 117, 7 (with Friedlsnd·
er’s note); Juvenal, 5, 147 (with Mayor's note); Catullus, 21', 13; Caesar,
B.C. 1, 83, 2, Cicero, Off 1, 135, etc. Esp. frequent in Martial-
vestem: i.e. the palla, regularly worn by Bacchus, cp. 1, 7, 46 and 11.
lt was part of the singer’s costume (cp. the famous story of Arion, Herod. 1,

446
