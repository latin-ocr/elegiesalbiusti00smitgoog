TIBVLLVS

as ‘i miei maestri,’ and ¹these pleasing and well-written poems
in terza rima-among the tirst of their name in a modern
language—are an ample justification ol this claim.

The deliberate use oi the literary echo together with a notable
enthusiasm lor the Roman poets, formal classicism combined with
a growing tendency to the idyllic erotic, were all favourable to the
popularity ol Tibullus in the eighteenth century. In this age of
Pope, Watteau, and Voltaire, of Dresden shepherdesses and pas-
toral operas, olpctr't-mattres and coeurs sensibks, the prominence
of Tibullus in the literatures ol Europe was more marked than
it has ever been except in his own time. France, Germany,
Italy, England, Spain— each really deserves a chapter by itself.

The translation of ‘Mn Dart' in 17²0 was followed by that
of James Graiuger in 1759. Both. are decidedly mediocre.
Apart too from the traditional echo, which becomes more sre-
quent, we now find 'occasional translations of favourite passages,
‘ imitations' os Tibullus, poems ‘written aster the manner of
Tibullus,' and the like. Indeed James Hammond’s(1710-1742)
poems to ‘Delia’ (Miss Dashwood)-practically⁴ all the verse
he ever wrote-owe their 'inspiration entirely to the elegies ol
our author.

In France the indications oi Tibullus’s popularity are even
more marked. Among translations may be mentioned those
of Pezai (1771), de Longchamps (1777), Pastoret (1784),
Mirabeau (1798), and Mollevault (1808). There are also fre-
quent ‘imitations' by La Harpe, Lebrun, loyson, Andrieux, etc.
Bertin, like Hammond, owes a large share os his inspiratiou to
Tibullus alone. The e'le‘gr'e itsell becomes more prominent and
the regular echo of our poet more frequent. Now too-and
apparently sor the first ¹time—we find, as in Voltaire, entire
poems suggested by a single passage. Les Amours de Tibulle
.by de la Chappelle (ad ed, 1732) is a sentimental romance
os Tibullus's life and adventures, in which is interspersed the
translation os his elegies. The book reminds one at once of the
