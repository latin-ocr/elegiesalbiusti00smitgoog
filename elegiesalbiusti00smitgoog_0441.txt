Vergil's epitaph, 4, ‘cecini pascua, rura, duces‚' rie. Eclogues, Georgics, Aeneid‚·
¹ Dom. Marsus, 4, ‘aut caneret forti regia bella pede’; Lucan, 1, 1, ‘bella
per Emathios plus quam civilia campos-canimus’; Hor. od. 1, 6, 1-4.
Lines 17-18 show that in this instance the specific type represented by Homer
and Vergil is referred to.

17-18. The Homeric epic was mentioned in the previous line. In these

lines the poet names two conventional subjects in the sphere of didactic epic, ,

cp. the work of Empedokles, Aratos, Lucretius, Manilius, the mythical Mu-

saiosandOrpbeus, and such references as Verg. A. 1, 740-746; E. 6, 31 ;

G. 2, 4773 Propert. 3, 5, 25; Apoll. Rhod. 1, 496; Orphic Argon. 2053
Manil. 1, 993 ovid, Met. 15, 713 Hor. Epist. 1, 12, 163 etc.

17. refero vias et qualia, etc: for the change of construction after the
same verb, cp. 1, 7,17.-qualis . . .recurrit: this single example in Tibullus
of the indicative iu an indirect question follows the construction frequent in old
Latin. lt disappeared in the classical historians (Caesar, Livy, Tacitus, etc),
but survives in the classical poets, Catullus, Vergil, Ovid, and esp. Propertius,
who does not hesitate to use both moods side by side, cp. 2, 16, 29, ‘aspice

quid donis Eriphyla invenit amaris, Ι arserit et quantis nupta Creusa malis'; ³

2, 34, 34,‘ut fluxerit . . . ut errat . . . qualis fuerit'; 52, ‘cur laboret . . .

si testabitur . . . si tonent'; esp. 3, 5,·25-46, which contains a series of 24 ’

indirect questions, 8 of which take the subjunctive and 16 the indicative.

τ After Propertius the tendency increases (Vitruvius, Petronius, Pliny, the poets,
the A'rchaists of the second century, etc.) and finally in Late Latin the indica·
tive becomes the rule.

19-20. See 13-2ou.

2ο. iata: 1, 6, 73 n.

21-23. The poet will be obliged to resort to murder and crime or, worse
yet, to sacrilege. This illustratiou of the power of love is practically identi-

cal with that of Plato, Rep. 574 D, where we are told that after such a des· .

perate slave of his passions has wasted his own property, the property of his
parents, and possibly even has laid violent hands upon them, ού πρῶτον μὲν
οίκίατ τινὸς ἐφάψεται τοίχου ἡ τινος ὀψὲ νύκτωρ ἰόντος τοῦ ίματίου, μετὰ δὲ
ταῦτα ἱερὸν τι νεωκορήσει.

aa. That is, as an exclusus amator, cp. 1, 2, 5-6 n.; Martial, 10, 13, 7, ‘ad
nocturna iaces fastosae limina moechae, Ι et madet heu, lacrimis ianua surda
tuis‚' etc-flebilis: active, cp. 1, 1, 8 n. ¹

23. Cp. 1, 2, 81-82. As in Plato the climax of crime is reached with
sacrilege. Cicero, Leg. 2, 9, 22, quotes the old law, ‘sacrum sacrove com-
mendatum qui clepsit rapsitve parricida esto.¹ The later Lex Iulia included
sacrilegium under the head of peculatus. In the Dr'gest, 48, 13, our most
