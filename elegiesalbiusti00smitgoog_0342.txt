conscias, see 1, 8, 33 Propert. 1, 10, 23 Seneca, T'hyest. 6323 Val. Flacc. 1, ς,
etc. For conscius with the dative occultis sacris (cp. 1, 6, 77 n), cp.
Thesaurus so. The dative with comcius of things appears first in this pas·
sage (cista), or perhaps in Vergil, A.4, 167. The two poets were writing
about the same time-and it is beyond doubt that they learned much srom
each other. The remaining exx. are all from the poets except Ps. Quint.
Dec. 17, 4 (Seneca, Med. 6; Phaed. 1073 Ovid, Her. 15,138; Stat. Theb.
8, 2063 9, 422; Sil. Ital. 3, 399; 5, 233 Avien. Orb. Terr. 381; Carm. Epig.
110, 53 1788, 7). The dative with conscius os persons begins with Cicero
(Verr.4,124; cluent. 563 11114144), and afterwards only in Ovid,
Ars Amat. 1, 3543 Met. 7, 1945 Lucan, 1, 203 Sil. Ital. 3, 3933 Lactant.

49-54. The genius (here the genius oi Messalla) is the spirit which acc. to
ant-ique and especially Roman belief was born with a man and attended him
through lite, Menandfrug. 18 inc. Mein, ἅπαντι δαίμων ἀνδρὶ consopiera-
ται Ι εὐθὺς γενομένῳ μυσταγωγὸς τοῦ βίου Ι ἀγαθός· Hor. Epist. 2, 2,188;
Censorinus, 3, ‘genius est deus cuins in tutela ut quisque natus est vivit,’ etc.
Awoman’s genius was called her Jnno, 4, 6, 1, n.; 3, 6, 48, Pliny, 2,16;
Petron. 253 Seneca, Epist. 110,1; etc.

Oue’s birthday is naturally as here the feast day ol the genius natalis. Only
bloodless sacrifices were made to him because (Varro, in Censor. Lc.) life
should not be taken on the day that lise was given. The nature os the sacri·
hccs offered, the ceremonial, etc, is fully described here, cp. also 2, 2, 13
21-223 4, 5, 193 Hor. Epist. 2, 1, 144, etc. A man's genius as such is
always good, the cause of happiness and of physical and spiritual health. It
is his good angel. But it is not infallible, and the genius of one man is osten
stronger than the genius of another. Throughout lile one's genius helps one
to whateveris good or pleasant, and also sympathizes with one in trouble„
und endeavours to warn one oi impending danger, etc, cp. Plutarch, Brut.
36 and 483 Val. Max. 1, 7, 73 Ammian. Marcell. 21, 143 etc. The iorehead
was sacred to him and one touched it in praying to him, Serv. on Verg. E.
6, 3; A. 3, 607. The idea that every man is attended by two spirits, a good
and a bad, comes not lrom the people but srorn the philosophers. On the
question ol birthdays in antiquity see esp. W. Schmidt, Geburtstug im Altertum,
Giessen, 1908 (‘Religionsgeschichtliche Versuche und Vorarbeiten,’ vol. 7,
part I).
