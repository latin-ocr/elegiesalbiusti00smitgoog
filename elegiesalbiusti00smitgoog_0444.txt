NOTES [2, 4, 32

For the power of gold in this department cp. also 1, 5, 68 n.; r, 4, 67';
Plautus, Asin. 182, and often in the Anth. Pal. eg. 5, 31, 32, 33, ιι3, 217.

31. clavim: the formis attested for this passage by the grammarian
Charisius (p. 126,41<.). This is really the proper form, although its occur·
rence elsewhere (Neue, I, p. 306) is confiued to Plautus, Most. 425. See 1,
6, 47n.

Alliteration in the sense demanded by the investigations of Wdlfflin has
already been treated in 1, 10, 65 u.; cp. also t, 6, 38, 1, 9, 213 2, 3, 80 aud
notes. But alliteration in a wider and freer sense is an ornament of poetry as
such, and the particularly skilful use of it by Tibullus has not a little todo with
the wonderful music of his verse. This type therefore does not and should
not impress itself upon the ear as alliteratiou, The main object of it isto
impart ease and harmony, to produce verses the mere music of which shall
charm the ear we know not why. Here, for instance, we have a triple allitera-
tion of this type. 1t is true, of course, that in Roman antiquity the three main
stumbliug blocks in the course of true love (clavis, custos, canis) happen to
be alliterative. It may be, too, that this was the best way to express the
thought of the line irrespective of alliteration. This, however, has nothing to
do with the effect produced by the alliteratiou, and a score of similar pen·
tameters and as many hexameters in Tibullus shows that the device was not
always due to accident or necessity. In many cases triple alliteration of this
type is accompanied by a fourth in the companion verse, cp. as here, t, 4, 2;
2,1,32; 2, 3, 8, 2,5,12o; 1, 4, 61 ; 2, 4, 47; 2, 6, 47: or with one pair, as
noemmasawnmnaatmaamumnotaaa
3, 393 γι, 4, 4, 3: or with two pairs,asin 1, 6, 35, 1, ιο, 39, etc.; epalso
1, 3, 763 1, 9, 13; 1, ιο, 65, 2,1,51; esp. 2, 3, 8. ,

Another type is represented by 1, 2, 54, which is meant to echo but not too
closely the hocus-pocus of an old popular charm, cp. 1, 3, 11 ; ι, 5, 13:
another, by 1, 2,9o; 1‚6‚ 36, 1, 8, 3ο, 2, 5, 9ο, 4, 5, 3, etc.

Alliteration between two words is extremely common and is often rein·

forced by a third, or eg. hya second alliterative pair in the companion line,

4, 3, ι3, and 1, 2, 33; 1, 3,29; r,4,21; 2,1,45; 1‚6‚ 37. ln 1, 6, 28 and
1, 6, 72 we have quadruple alliteratiou, two in each line.

In nearly every instance these alliterations indicate or emphasize some ’

relation, not only syntectical, but rhetorical (comparison, contrast, chiasmus,
etc). Very common too is the use of this device to emphasize the metrical
constructiones the distich (see Introd. p. 104). Juxtaposition, for example,
a favourite method of marhing contrasts, comparisons, etc, is most frequent at
