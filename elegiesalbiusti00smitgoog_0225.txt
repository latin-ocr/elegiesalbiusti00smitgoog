01 simples as she was flying over that country on her dragon aster leaving
Jason.

52. Hecatae: the Dea Triformis (Selene in heaven, Artemis on earth,
Hekate in hell) was the great goddess 01 the magicians and was regularly
invoked by them, esp. in the moon cbarm, ie. the charin by which she
herself as the moon goddess isforced to come down and do the magician’s
will, cp. 1, 8, 21-22 and notes. She is osten called Trivia (see 1, 5,16n.),
‘Diana 01 the Crossways,’ because habitually worshipped at the trivia, cp. 1,

· 5, 54 n. 01 all the old gods her cult was perhaps the most persistent and

her memory the hardest to die. In the eleventh century Burchardus, Bishop
01 Worms (Decreta, 10, 1) observes that, ‘quaedam sceleratae mulieres . . .
credunt se et profitentur nocturnis horis cum Diana paganorum dea vel cum
= Herodiade et innumera multitudine mulierum equitare super quasdam bestias
et multa terrarum spatia intempestae noctis silentio pertransire eiusque iussio·
nibus velut dominae oboedire et certis noctibus ad eius servitium evocari,’ etc.
This is the witch ride which in connection with the witches' sabbath assumed
such importance in the prosecutions 01 the witches during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. The crass-reads are still uncanny. It is not so long
since suicides were buried there and a stake driven through their remains (to
prevent them lrom returning as vampiresP), and to this day the lact that
those who sear spirits prefer to avoid the crosa-roads aiter dark shows that
Trivia the queen 01 the ghosts is still to be reckoned with.

The whelps 01 Hekate are often mentioned. They always accompany her
aud herald her approach: Apollon. Rhod. 3, 1216, ἀμφὶ δὲ τήνγε Ι ὀξείῃ ὑλακῇ
χθόνιοι κύνες ἐφθέγγοντο; Theokritos, 2, 353 Verg. A. 6, 257; Hor. Sat. 1, 8, 353

Lucan, 6, 733; Seneca, Oed. 5693 Medea, 840; Thyest. 675 ; Stat. Theb. 4, 3

4293 etc. The basis 01 the idea is no doubt the well-known ellect of moon-

light on dogs. lt was (and to a certain extent still is) felt that they perceive Ἴ
the approach 01 spirits and can see them better than we, cp. 1, 5, 54 n., and ¹

some ancient representations 01 Endymion in which the dog is highly excited
by the approach 01 the goddess to his sleeping master.

Greek words are rare in Tibullus and ior the most part proper names (excep-
tione are eg. smaragdus 1, 1, 51 ; 2, 4, 275 catasta, 2, 3, 60; hippomanes, 2,
