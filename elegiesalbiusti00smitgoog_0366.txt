- noras ο [1,9,o

πόδα βαίνεις· Suidas, Ποιναὶ Τιμωροί τοῖς κακοῖς ἀκολουθοῦσιν οὐχ ὣς σκιαὶ
σώμασι πλησίον, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀψὲ τοῦ χρόνον· Cornutus, Theol..Graec. 13 (of
Opis as aname of Nemesis),'Orts δὲ drd τοῦ λανθάνουσα καὶ ὥσπερ παρα·
κολουθοῦσα ὄπισθεν καὶ παρατηροῦσα τὰ πραττόμενα ὑφ’ ἡμῶν κολάζειν τὰ
κολάσεως ἄξια· Eurip. frag. 22 33 Grat. δοκοῖεν. 455, ‘discet commissa quantum
deus ultor in ira Ι pone sequens valeat: The genuinely popular form is seen
in Petron. 44, ‘dii pedes lanatos habent'; Porphyr. on Hor. Od. 3, 2, 32;
Macrob. 1, 8, ς. The homely and expressive parallel in modern Italy is,
‘Iddio non fa i conti ogni sabbato,’ ‘God does not balance accounts every
Saturdap’

Martinon truly observes that Tibullus here is inconsistent with himself in
1, 4, 21. See, however, lines 5-6‚ below. Moreover, as has already heen
observed (see Introd. p. 44), each elegy of Tibullus is meant to be dealt with
as an independent work of art. Finally, who expects lovers to be consistent?
‘incerta haec si tu postules Ι ratione certa facere‚' says Parmeno (Ter. Eun. 61),
‘nihilo plus agas Ι quamsi des operam ut curn ratione in'sanias’ — the origin
apparently of Voltaire’s definition of metaphysics as ‘L'art de s'egarer avec
raison.’ ,

On the artistic arrangement of epithets in this line, ep. 2, 3, 40 n.

5-12. The touch of compunction which forms an artistic transition to the
next topic is eminently characteristic of the kindly and generous poet, cp. eg.
ι, 5,41; 1, 6, 553 69; 853 1, ro, 61; 2, 6, 41. But there are real and
therefore artistic limits, aud here shame has combined with sorrow to produce
a situation not to be compared with the last of the elegies to Delia (1, 6),
still less with any other poem of Tibullus. Here alone the characteristic im·
pulse to condone occurs only at the beginning and'then completely disappears
before the crescendo of anger and disgust which accompanies the poet's
growing realization of the boy's real character as well as of his own folly. ’

5-6. The plea is characteristic, cp. ag. Propertius, 2, 28, 49 (in a prayer
that Cynthia who is ill may be spared)‚ ‘sunt apud infernos tot milia formosa-
rum: Ι pulchra sit in superis, si licet, una locis,’ and on the other hand, in
quite a different mood, the rhetorical and irreverent 0vid, Amor. 3, 3, 29,
‘nobis (i.e. ‘us men’) flexibiles curvantur Apollinis arcus, Ι in nos alta Iovis
dextera fulmen habet: Ι formosas superi metuunt offendere laesi Ι atque
ultro, quae se non timuere timent. Ι . . . quid queror et toto facio convicia
caelo? Ι di quoque habent oculos, di quoque pectus habent! Ι si deus ipse
forem, numen sine fraude liceret Ι femina mendaci falleret ore meum: Ι ipse
ego iurarem verum iurare puellas Ι et non de tetricis dicerer esse deus?

6. semel, etc: a genuinely popular touch, cp. eg. Ovid, Amor. 2, 14, 43,
‘di faciles, peccasse semel concedite tuto: Ι et satis est ; poenam culpa secunda
