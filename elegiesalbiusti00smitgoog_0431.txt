,mercium gentibus accersuntur, ut matronae nostrae ne adulteris quidem plus

Epist. 90, 20, ‘quid, si contigisset illi videre has nostri temporis telas, quibus
vestis nihil celatura conficitur, in qua non dico nullum corpori auxilium, sed

nullum pudori esti' Seneca Rhet. Contrua. 2, 7 (p. 239 Kiessl.), ‘infelices 3
ancillarum greges laborant ut adultera tenui veste perspicua sit et nihil in l
corpore uxoris suae plus maritus quam quilibet alienus peregrinusque cogno· ζ
verit’ (an interesting passage because it shows that here as elsewhere the ,
principal reason why we hear so much of this theme in the later writers is ¹

because it entered the rhetorical schools at an early date).
54. auratas . . . vias: ‘disposed upon them patha of gold' is a literal
translation. The occurrence elsewhere of viae in this connection is confined

to Servius on Verg. A. 8, 660, where he explains virgatis lucent sagulis as ‘quae Ἴ

habebant in virgarum modum deductas vias! The only parallel in Greek and
the only occurrence of the word in that sense is the οἴμοι, the viae or paths of
gold, tin, and kyanos inlaid in the famous breastplate of Iliad, 11, 24. In the
passage before us disponere presupposes regular patterns of some sort, and
the suggestion of viae is that these patterns were traced in a line or band of
embroidery in gold, aaa path, a street as it were, of gold running wherever
dictated by the pattern. The dictionaries translate by ‘stripes' In that
case the pattern in question would be narrowed down practically to parallel
bands of embroidery, let us say for example, three or four around the bottom
of the skirt. But this is too definite. Tbeolpnr of Homer were arranged in
parallel bands, hence the translation of ‘stripes’ is accepted and appropriate.
‘Stripes,’ however, is derived from the known details of the pattern; it is not
inherent in οἶμοι itself (so far as we know). Hence viae here, even though,
as may well be the case, it was derived through translation or otherwise from
the Homeric prototype itself, does not involve the restrictiori to stripes. In-
deed it would appear that Servius at least did not so interpret the word,
otherwise he would hardly have added ‘in virgarum modum,' ‘in the manner
of rods,’ i.e. ‘stripes,’ to describe the pattern suggested by deducus vias.
'lhere is a kindred but obscure use of via as an architectural term (unique) in
Vitruvius, 4, 3, 6. ⁴

55-56. Coloured attendants were a luxury especially affected by women like
Nemesis largely because, as in England and France during the 17th and 18th
centuries, they suggested the fortune and the position of foreign potentates,

nabobs, etc, cp. eg. Terence, Eun. 165 (to Thais), ‘nonne ubi mi dixti χ

cupere te ex Aethiopia l ancillulam, relictis rebus omnibus Ι quaesivi i’
