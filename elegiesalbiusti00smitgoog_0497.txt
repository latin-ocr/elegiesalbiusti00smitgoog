This poem is ostensibly written by Sulpicia herself (Introd. p. 78) and
occasioned by the fact that ber lover Cerinthus has gone off on a boar bunt.
The theme, its development, the atmospbere, are all highly characteristic oi
the erotic elegy, cp. eg. Phaidra and Hippolytes (Euripides, Ovid, etc.),
Venus and Adonis (Bion, Ovid, eto), Milanion and Atalanta the Huntress

(Propert. 1, 13 ovid, Ars Anrat. 2, 185, etc), all iavourite themes since the
beginning ol the Alexandrian Age, and all laying stress on most oi tbe ideas

presented bere. See Maass, Hermes, 24, 526 ; F. Wilhelm, Rhein. Mus. 61, 95.

There was an extensive literature in antiquity on the subjectos hunting in
all its brancbea. The most important remains are, on the Greek side, the
K ynegetikos oi Xenophon, a prose tract, and the K ynegetika oi Oppian, a
poem in four boolrs3 and on the Roman side, the cynegetica of Grattius and
another poem os the same name by Nemesianus. The best poetioal descrip-
tion in latin os a hunt is Seneca, Phaedra, 1-84 Among the Romans hunt·
ing was distinctly a gentleman’s pursuit, see Introd. p. 86.

‘Peithee savage boat, spare my beloved wheresoever he meeteth thee.
Accursed be hunting and all that pertains to it! What madness it is to
choose a sport so full os toil, discomtort, and danger! And yet, Corinthus, if
I might be with you Iwould carry the neta myself, 1 would traclr the swilt
deer, I would hold the dogs in leash. Nay, blessed be the wild wood did
you but embrace me there. Surely the boarit he saw us then would go away
