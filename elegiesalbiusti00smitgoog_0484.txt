sores . [2,6, 11' ·

4. volat: on the shift, cp. 1, 1, ²4 ιι.

5-6. Proposes the alternative. The poet thinks it more likely (cp. ‘sit
. . . gerat’ above), and in fact this is Cupid’s method of dealing with all
such cases, ep. line ιι below, and often.

5. ure: 1, 5, 5 n.-tua oties cp. Ovid, Rem. Amor. 139, ‘otia si tollas,
periere Cupidinis arcus,’ ete. —ferus2 r'.e. ‘untamed,’ ‘rebellious,’ cp. ι, 5, 5.

6. Returns for the moment to the time-honoured association of Love and
War, ‘militat omnis ampns et habet sua castra Cupido,' Ovid, Amor. t, 9, 13
ep. 2, 9, 3; and often. Hence erronem, 'the runaway’ (generally of slaves)
here = ‘the deserter,' cp. Ovid, Her. 19, ι 57, ‘ in tua castra redi, socii desertor
amorisl’

7-1o. The thought, however, that Cupid may make an exception in favour of
soldiers sheds a momentary gleam of hope on his own case. Indeed, in his
flash of enthusiasm the poet drops into the conversational idiom.

7. erit ltlc quoque mlles: this deictic use of hic = ego (usually with homo)

belongs to the common speech and islargely confined to conpedy, cp. Plautus,
Bacch. ⁶4⁰3 Curc. ²485 Epidr413 Trin.172; rrr5; Ter. Adel. 906,
And. 3to; Heaut. 3565 etc. The one case in the satire seems to be Hor.
Sat. 1, 9, 47, ‘haberes Ι magnum adiutorem posset qui ferre secundas, Ι hune
hominem velles si tradere,' where it is to be noted that the speaker is the
vulger bore. In Greek, on the contrary, the corresponding use (ὅδε ὁ ἀνήρ,
ἀνὴρ ὅδε, ὅδε) is esp. frequentin tragedy; cp. also Herod. r, 108; Antiphon,
6, 95 etc. .
8. lpse: ie. he will gladly serve as the most ordinary soldier who hss to
wait on himself -a special hardship in a slaveholding country, cp. t, 1, 7 n.
-levem aquam: i.e. ‘shifling,' ‘easily moving,’ ‘nimble,’ cp. 2, 5, 96 ιι.;
Hor. Epod. 16, 47, ‘ montibus altis Ι levis crepante lympha desilit pede ’ ; Ovid,
Fasti, 5, 662, ‘levis cursum sustinuistis aquae '; etc.

For this use of the helmet—a natural touch - cp. Propert. 3, 12, 8, ¹ pota·
bis galea fessus Araxis aquam’; Eleg. in Maec. 58; Lucan, 9, 5023 Claud.
III Cous. Honor. 49.

ιο. Ovid, Her. 16, 352, ‘finge tamen, si vis, ingens consurgere bellumrl
et mihi sunt vires, et mea tela nocent’; Trist. 1, 3, 83, ⁸ te sequar et coniunx
exulis exul ero, Ι etmihi facta viast, et me capit ultima tellus'

ιι. magna loquor: i.e. lines 9-10. For the situation and the sentiments
cp. 1, 5, 1-6, where see the notes. See also r, 2, 89-96 and notes. The
expression is found iu all styles and periods, and as here generally il-
lustrates the thought that pride goeth before a fall, cp. Sen. Herc. Fur. 295,
‘magna sed nimium loquor'; 436, ‘tenebrae loquentem magua Tartareae
premunt’; Ovid, Her. 4, 1503 Verg. A. ιο, 5473 Hor. Od. 4, 6, 13 etc. So
