TlBVLLVS

os Messalla's circle beside Tibullus himself who was capable oi

writing a piece oi this peculiarly difficult type, in which grace, deli· ¹

cacy, and good breeding are so exquisitely blended.

The next piece, in which our poet assumes the person os
Sulpicia herself, is occasioned by the lact that her lover has
gone on a boar hunt. As we read the poem we are inevitably
reminded os Venus and Adonis, or os Phaidra and Hippolytus,
long familiar to the elegiae sphere as the traditional prototypes

of lovers the conventional situation oi the elegy is reversed.
The girl writes the poetry, the youth has nothing to say ; or at

by the birthday of Sulpicia, and here as before the poet acts

as spokesman. The two poems are companion pieces, and ἲ

should he compared throughout.
