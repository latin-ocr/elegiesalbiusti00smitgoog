61-62. In the poet's lively fancy the wish of the preceding distich is now
a certainty, hence he shifts to the indicative with flebis, etc. For other cxx.
see r, r, 24 n. ’

61. flebis . . . me z for th. accus. with verbs of emotion, 1, 3, 14 n.—posi·
111111. . . recto: lecto is used for feretro, as often in poetry and later prose.

Elsewhere in Tib. ponere and verbs of placing follow the usual rule of in with
the ablat.; for deponere in sinum, 4, 7, 4, see the note. The omission of prep-
ositions with the ablat. of the place where is generally phraseological (eg.
terra marique as above) or characteristic of poetry. That here it is sometimes
a matter 01 convenienceis suggested, eg, by nostra donea 2, 3, 34, but in tota
doato, 1, 5, 30, templis tuis, 1, 3, 283 in exigam aede, 1, 10, 20, in Iovis
arce, 2, 5, 16, secretis silvis, 4, 13, 9, olentibus arvis, 4, 2, 17, Arretino
agro, 4, 8, 4, but desertus in agris, 1, 1, 11 ; mensae in orbe ducere, 1, 6, 20,
but aestivo orbe convocare, 1, 2, 50 (though here time as well as place might
be considered); quibus e'n ferris occulere, 1, 7, 24, but abdere tristibus agris,
2, 3, 66, where, however, the force of the old instrumental was felt for the
moment, so pleno pinguia musta locu, 1, 1, 10, but plenis e'n lintribus uvas.
1, 5, 23, in nocfeprosunda, 1, 3, 67, in tenebris, 1, 10, 50, pendere e'n ar·
bore, 2, 5, 29.

⁶³44· The combination of steel and flint in this figurative use is proverbial
in both Greek and Latin, cp. 1, 10, 59. Mustard cites Sannazaro, Eleg. 1, 9,

non mihi circumstat solidum praecordia ferrum,
nec riget in nostro pectore dura silex.

⁶3· flebis : on the anaphora, ²3 n.

⁶4. stat: perhaps suggests the idea of permanence, of resistance to out·
side pressure, already seen in ‘duro praecordia ferro vincta,’ cp. 2, 4, 8-10.
The lrinship 01 stare and erreis shown, for instance, by the fact that when the
new system of perfecte developed in the Romance languages the missing
participle of esse was supplied by stare. Note too that in Spanish estar
(stare) is used with the gerundive to make the progressive forms of the
active verb, as estoy bollando, ‘l am speaking! So also in Italian, eg. ‘sto
parlando.’ But in cases like the one before us, where esse might have been
used, the best general statement oi the difference between the two seems to be
that esse is colourless, stare gives the picture. Cp. 1, 6, 49, 2,4,9; Verg.
E. 7, 53, ‘stant et iuniperi et castaneae hirsutae’; A. 3, 210, ‘Strophades
Graio stant nomine dictae' , Α. 2, 333, G. 4, 209, Ηο1. Od. 1, 9, 1 ς Lucret.
5, 199, ‘tanta stat praedita culpa (natura) '3 1, 564, 1, 747 , our ‘ he isac-
quitted,' or · he stands acquitted,’ etc.

65-66. Note the artistic arrangement of the sentence. Professor Mustard
