and thought is in itsels sufficient indication 01 the poet's attitude toward his
subject.

1-2. The wish is emiuently appropriate. As a god 01 the country-side in
general (floclrs, bees, etc.) and 01 gardens, orchards, and vineyards in par·
1101111 (1, 1,17-18 n), Priapos pasees his entire existence out 01 doors.
Occasionally he has a little iane 01 his own (Anti. Pal. 6, 2543 Priap. 1, 3;
14, 23 82 ; 86, 8; Petron. 17), now and then he secures the shelter 01 a
tree (Priap. 83, 6), 11111101 the most parthe stands under the open sky and
has to taire the weather (cp. lines 2 and 5-6 below) as it comes, cp. Priap.
14,8; 63,1; 83, 123 1101. Sat. 1, 8, 37 ; etc.

Note that here as elsewhere in antiquity the address to the gods assumes
the character 01 1 conditional sentence. The thing desired by the suppliant
is the condition, the wish that the god himself shall receive some benefit is the

conclusion—said conclusion to hold good in case 1110 condition, i.e. the ³

prayer, is lultilled3 a manifestation 01 the idea 01 ⁶ quid 010 quo' which finds
its most natve expression in the theory 01 ex-votos. So 2,5, 121 and else-
where.

1. sic: 10 always. Tibullus never uses ita, cp. 1, 6, 2111.

2. soles: ale the heat 01 the sun day in and day out. Τ110 plural 111111-
tributive (1, 1,411.), the sun of each day is conceived 01 as a separate sun.

3-6. One should keep in mind the actual appearance 01 Priapos in order
to realize the 1111110100 01 the question. One then sees that the humour 01
the situation is heightened hythe evident gentleuess with which the poet,
always courteous and well-bred‚ alludes 10 what presumably might be a tender

point. Priapos however is not sensitive‚ 110 has no illusious regarding his ap· ,
pearance or accomplishments. He is made 01 wood (preferably lig 01 0111) in
the rough and ready 11111100 01 primitive days, 11111 is therefore 111 110111 hand· ἶ
some, cp. Priap. 10, 23 39, 53 Hor. Sat. 1, 8,-r; Anah. Pal. 6, 22, 53 ⁴

9, 437, 2. Ovid, Ars Amat. 2, 123, uses Odysseus to illustrate his contention
that eloquence is better than beauty. Priapos does not believe it. 110111111-
1011 11 1101 eloquent and has no learning, cp. Priap. 3,10; 68, 1. He is justa

plain country god, good·natured (Theokrit. 1, 81) and with no desire to ap· ³

0011 dignified (Priap. 14). indeed, Priapos and dignity are incompatible.

Hence, though worshipped in all seriousness, he always remained‚ at least 1
101 literary purposes (in which the Alexandrian tradition 01 him is reflected), j

. something 01 a hutloon among the immortals3 cp. Priap. 63, 11; Arnob. 6, 25. ,
3. formosos: evidently a translation 01111111 term regularly applied 1

by the Greek puerorum amator to his favourite, so osten 011 drinking cups as y
well as in the literature, cp. the Ἔρωτες ἢ Kahat 01 Phanolrles (Introd. p. 19). 1

Priapos appears as apuerorum amaror in the early Alexandrian Age (cp.
