⁸ the Aetolians. Cp. also Catuli. 16, 13 3 1161. Epist. 1, 3, 6, and for the cohors
61 imperial times (hence, corte, cour, ‘court ’), Nero’a cohors anticorum ,-
Sueton. Tib. 46, etc.

3-9. Imitated by Lygdamus, 3, 2,9 ff. The poet dreads death in a strange
land aa opposed to death at home and among kiudred, the fitting close 61 a
lile 61 happiness and peace, as in 1, 1, 59-68. Tne touching passage 61
Ovid, T rirt. 3, 3, 37 ff, ‘tarn procul ignotis igitur moriemur in oris,’ etc., was
probably suggested by these lines. The feeling, however, is shared by all
humanity‚ cp. eg. Propert. 3, 7, 811. and 63 ff. (to Paetus); Vergil, A. 9,
485 11.; Homer, Odyss. 24, 2961111111 esp. Sophokles, Elekt. 113611. (cp.

869). Epiktetos, 1, 27, 5, says, ἀκούεις τῶν ἰδιωτῶν λεγόντων ’τάλας ἐκεῖνος, ,
ἀπέθανεν· ἀπώλετο ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ, ν) μήτηρ· ἐξεκόπη, ἀλλὰκαὶ ἄωρος nal ert

“villum 3-4 are alluded to by Ovid in his elegy on the death 61 Tibullus

(Amor. 3, 9, 47), ‘sed tamen hoc melius, quamsi Phaeacia tellus Ι ignotum
vili supposuisset humo!

3. ignotis terris: 1,1,8n.; 1,3, 39. Cp. Theokrit.Epig. 11, 3, εΰμιν
ἔθαψαν ἑταῖροι tot ξείνης ξένον soro-⁴ a stranger in a strange laud ’ —though
the original 61 6111 expression is the less poetic words 61 Exod. 2, 2211117111-
ros. . . ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ. -Pnaeacias Σχερία, Homet's land 61 the Phaeacians,
was identified with the island 61 Corcyra (Κερκύρα, Herod, Thuk. and now,
Ι Κορκύρα, early inscript, coins, Strabo ; Corsis, the mediaeval name, is 116111 the
Byz. Kopupat, the ‘twin cliffs’ upon it).

4. Greedy death (cp. 65) who lays violent hands ou his victim is a popular
conception, cp. ‘auferet Orcus,’ ‘abstulit cita Mors,’ 'rapuit Fatum,’ and
similar expressions common in the epitaphs. So too, Ovid, Amor. 3, 9, 19,
‘scilicet omne sacrum mors importuna profanat, Ι omnibus obscuras inicit illa
manus'3 Kallimach. Epig. 2, 53 eto-Mora atra: oter, which as opposed
to niger is symbolic as well as literal, is a common epithet 61 mors, see
Appendix. Ι

5-8. The ashes 61 the dead were gathered up, spriukled with wine and
milk, mixed with persumes, and placed in an urn. The duty belonged to the
chief mourner, cp. the epitaph (Carm. Eprg. 1149, 3, Buech.), ’111νί131111-
sentem mater, flevere sodales, Ι et mater tepido condedit ossa rogo'z Propert,
161 his father (4, 1, 127), and be requests Cynthia to do the amnne for him
(2, 24, 49), reminding her, ‘noli nobilibus noli conferre beatis: lvix venit
extremo qui legat ossa die Ι hi tibi nos erimus! See also Propert. 2, 9, 9 ff.;
Ovid, Amor. 3, 9, 4911.; Lygd. 3, 2, 173 Lucan, 9, 603 etc.

5. abstineas, etc.: 1, 2, 9 n. The epanalepsis serves here as the transi·
tion, as in 2, 4, 20.-hic mini mater: it is a universal law of metrical art
