theless likes to have others admire her, because their envy oi his good fortune
flatters his vanity; ‘prorsus quasi silentium damnum pulchritudinis esset)
says lustinus, 1, 7, in his account ol Kandaules, the traditional ex. oi this
type. So Martial to a certain Lesbia (1, 34, 3, ‘et plus spectator quam te
delectat adulter Ι nec sunt grata tibi gaudia si qua latent').

' For ‘nil opus invidia est' see 4, 4, 21, and lor ‘ gloria vulgi,' 1, ro, 11, with
note. Professor Postgate thinks the use ol these phrases here is ‘uncum-
fortable! invidia of course is the more dangerous because the very word
carries with it the suggestion ol the evil eye and hence the possibility that
one's good fortune, il people know of it, may actually be destroyed by magic,

8. in tacito gaudeat sinu: gaudere in sinu is proverbial, cp. Cic. Tusc.
Disput. 3, 513 Seu. Epist. 105, 3; Hom. Odyss. 22, 41¹3 etc. Ridicule,
however, is never involved, as in ‘to laugh in one’s sleeve,' ‘sich ins Faust-
chen lachen! The wise man keeps his good fortune to himself. An English
equivalent sometimes seen in our old plays is ‘he (sie. the foul) munet fare
well without crying roast meat! Propertius says (2, 25, 30), ‘tu tamen
interea, quamvis te diligat illa, Ι in tacito cohibe gaudia clausa sinu Ι . . .
invidiam quod habet non solet esse diu.’ But the addition os tacito as here
to a common proverbial saying hardly needs to be explained by imitation.
'Close congeners ag. are Plautus, apid. 651, ‘qnod boni est id tacitus taceas
tute tecum et gaudeas'; Ter. Hec. 106, ‘haud propterea te rogo, Ι ut hoc
proferam, sed tacita ut mecum gaudeam' (Volpi). The thought, of course,
is continually recurring. The classical example ol the wisdom ol our poet’s
choice is the story ol Gyges and Kandaules; see also Ovid, Ars Amat. 1, 741,
‘ei mihi, non tutumst quod ames laudari sodali ! Ι cum tibi laudanti credidit
ipse subit,' a commentary on his own elegy, Amor. 3, 12, 7 f.

9-12. No doubt it is partly due to Cowley that these lines, esp. the last

two, seem to be well known to the English poets. ln his essay on Solitude
he says, ‘When they are in love with a mistress, all other persons are importu- ·
nate aud burdensome to them. Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam lubens.’
He then quotes these four lines and translates—

With thee lor ever l 111 woods could rest,

Where never human foot the ground has prest,
Thou from all shades the darkness crinst exclude,
And lrom a desert banish solitude.

lle had already imitated 7-12 in The Wisi, the last stanza ol which is—

How happy here should 1,
And one dear She live, and embracing diel
She who is all the world, and can exclude
