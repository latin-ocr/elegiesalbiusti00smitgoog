1, 3, 72] TIBVLLVS

ture, esp. in the Roman poets, with a number of snakes. These grow out ot
his body, frequently about the neck (Plato, Raep. 588 C). So too his tail
often ends in a serpent's head (Verg. Α. 6, 4193 Culex, 2203 Hor. Od. 3,
11,17; Ovid, Met. ro, 21; Sil. Ital. 13, 5943 esp. Seneca, Herc. Fur. 786,
etc). -ors: sor the sing. where we should use the plural see 1, 1, 42 n.

72. aeratas iores: so Homer, ll. 8, ¹53 Verg. Α. 6, 552, and cp. Milton's
(P. L. 2, 655) ‘and thrice threelold tlte gates: three folds were brass, Ι Three
iron, three os adamantius rock, 1 Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire,l
Yet unconsumed.’ Bronze is a proverb ol the invincible and the imperish-
able, cp. Horace’s 'robur et aes triplex,' Od. 1, 3, 93 ‘exegi monumentum
aere perennius,’ 3, 30, 1, eto-excubat: ‘stands on guard? A military
word.

73-80. The poet names four oi the five famous examples oi sin and its
reward. Sisyphos is omitted. No description os Hades was complete tvith·
out two or more of these causes celibres.

73-74. Ixion ‘bound to his own Iynx wheel’ appears first in Pind. Pyth. 2,
21, cp. Soph. Phil. 680. Many later writers follow Pindar and locate the
punishment oi Ixion in the upper air, cp. Philost. Apollon. Tyan. 6, 40 and
7, ιι, etc. Ixion and his wheel do not appear in Hades until the Alexan-
drian Age (first in Apoll. Rhod. 3, 62), but the change ol place probably
goes back to the tragedy. Ace. to Hyginus, Fab. 62 (cp. eg. the well-known
picture iu the House of the Vettii at Pompeii) he was bound to the wheel by
Mercury, according to some (Schol. on Eurip. Phoeniss. 1185) it was ol flames,
and once (Verg. G. 3, 39) the additional torture oi a serpent is mentioned.

75-76, The punishment of Tityos is nomene, and Homer’s description
(Odyss. 11, 576) is closely followed by Lucretius (3, 984). Vergil's descrip-
tion (A. 6, 595) was influenced by the story of Prometheus and apparently
shows an attempt to meet the objection raised by Lucretius, Lc.

75. novem iugera: the tradition is Homeric, so Propert. 3, 5, 44; Ovid,
Met. 4, 4573 Ibis,181; etc. Pausanias, ro, 4, 5, gives an explanation aster the
manner oi Euhemeros. Quintus Smym. 3, 396 says, πουλυπέλεθροε.

7⁶. adsiduas aves: the παρημένω γῦπε of Homer. It isdoubtiul, however,
whether adsiduas is to be taken literally, cp. Ovid, Ibis, 182, ‘visceraque
assiduae debita praebet avi'; Mart. Sp. 7, 2, ‘Prometheus Ι adsiduam nimio
pectore pavit avem) One vulture instead of two appears first in Vergil, and
the change is perhaps due to contamination with the story of Prometheus.
But the Vergilian version seems to be confined to the Roman poets, and even
there is by no means general. singular in Hor. Od. 3, 4, 77; Claud. De Rapa
Pros. 2, 341. Plural in Propert. 2, ao, 3r; Statius, Theb. rr, ¹43 4, 538„
Ovid and Seneca are inconsistent-singular in Ovid, Ibis, 182; Seneca, Herc.
