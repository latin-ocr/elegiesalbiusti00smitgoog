2, 1, 32] ’ TIBVLLVS

' equivalent to ‘quotiens biberit totiens dicat,' the idea of repetition being
furuished by pocula, a distributive plural like somnos, cp. 1, 1, 4 n.
32. Except for absentis, which adds the information that Messalla is not

· present, the pentameter amplifies the hexameter simply by repeating the con· Ἴ

tent of it in another form. ‘nomen absentis' = ‘bene Messallam,’ ‘singula
verba sonent’ = ‘quisque dicat.' singula therefore really = cuiusque. This

, use of an adjective instead of a genitive is common in the poets.¹ The familiar Ἴ

ex. in ordinary prose is aes alienum, ‘other people's money,'¹ i.e. debt. For
this type of amplification in the pentameter, see 1, 1, 44 n. ’ ἵ

On the custom of drinking to the absent, see esp. Theokrit. 14, 18 f. Accotd· ¹
ing to the old Scholiast ad loc. unmixed wine was taken, and as it was poured

on the ground the name of the absent friend or sweetheart was uttered aloud, l
cp. Hor. Od. 3, 19, 95 Alexis, 2, 336 K.; Argentar. Anth. Pal. 5, 110;
Meleager, Ante. Pal. 5, 136 and 1375 etc. The famous words of Theramenes i
Κριτίᾳ τοῦτ’ ἔστω τῷ καλῷ (Xen. Hell. 2, 3, 56; cp. Cicero, T mc. Disput. l

1, 96), refer rather to the game of kottabos and are not a parallel here.

33. celeber: here = clarus. Perhaps the earliest example of the word in
this sense so familiar to ns. In classical prose it isvery rarely used of persons
as here, cp. also 1, 3, 33; 1, 6, 17 and notes-triumphis: see for the plural
r, 7, 5 n. The use of the genitive with triumphus is not nncommon in prose,
cp· Livy, ό, 7, 4; 33, 37, ιο; etc·

For the event referred to see Introd. p. 35, and 1, 7.

34. intonsis avis: often applied to the old Romans, esp. by the poets, cp.
Ovid, Fasti, 2, 305 6, 2643 Hor. Od. 1, 12, 41; 2,15,11; Plutarch, Romul. 163
etc. Varro, De Re Rust. 2, 11, 10, and Pliny, 7, 211, tell ns that the first
barbers cameto Rome in 309 Μ.

.The dative with a substantive (gloria avis) is used by Tib. only here.
More common in Vergil and Propertius.

35-86. Now that the festivities announced in 27 f. are on the way and
that a neat compliment to Messalla has been turned, the poet proceeds with
his next topic, the formal announcement of which is ‘ rura cano rurisque deos)
In the lines which follow he again displays his surpassing gift of concealing
the utmost care and skill of development under the garb of unstudied sim·
plicity. As usual, too, the theme was already well worn. Lines 35-36 serve,
while paying another compliment to Messalla, as the transition.

36. agricolis: the reference is purposely indefinite and the word returns
to its rare adjectival use, see 1, r, 14; 1, 5, 27 and notes.

37. Here the poet again talres up a favonrite theme with the antique
poeta and thinkers‚ the growth of civilization, cp. 1, 7, 29-483 1, 3, 35 fi. and
notes; Ovid‚ Amor. 3,10‚9; etc.
