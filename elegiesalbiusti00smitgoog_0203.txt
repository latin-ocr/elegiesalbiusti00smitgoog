1, 1, 49] TIBVLLVS

3, 37-40 n. Here, however, as the next distich shows, Tib. was not thinking
of the foolhardy trader who takes his life in his hand merely for greed of gaiu,
but of another source of danger and fatigue to the soldier. After the con·
quests of Caesar aud Pompey, campaigning included long journeys by sea as
well as hy land. Hence 53 and vias in 52.

49. hoc mihi contingat: for similar transitione, 1,1ο,43; Ovid, Amor. Ι

31 2, 91 etc·

⁵⁰· tristes: see 1, 5, 5011.

51-58. The inspiration of Parny’s ‘Le Voyage Mauqudss Pofsies Erotiques,
Liv. 3, ‘Abjurant ma douce paresse, Ι J’allais voyager avec t0i; Ι Mais mon
coeur reprend sa faiblesse; Ι Adieu, tu partitas sans moi,' etc.

. 51-52. Professor Mastard finds an echo of this distich in Joauues Secundus,
Eleg. 3, 2-
Crede mihi, non est armorum gloria tanti
ut fleat ulla tuas maesta puella vias.

51. quantum ast auri: as au emphatic expression of totality, is confined
in Tib. to this passage. Not found at all in Propertius, nor have 1 been able
to discover it in any other Roman poet except Catullus, 3, 2 and 9, 10. Note,
however, Terence, Phorm. 853, ‘o omnium, quantumst qui vivont, homo ho·
minum ornatissume,' and cp.Plaut. Aul. 7853 Bacch. 1170; Capt.836; Pom.
903 Pseud 3513 Rud. 706. Quite common, on the contrary, is the similar
use with quid, quidquid, and quodcumque, Tibullus, 1, 6, 33 2, 2, 153 2, 3,
r4; 2, 4, 55 and 5⁶³ 4, 4, 7.-auri . . . smaragdi: this contrast to the
conventional division of possessions in 1, 1-2, suggested to the Romans
quite as clearly as it does to us ‘The wealth of Ormus and of lnd Ι Or where
the gorgeous East with richest hand Ι Showers on her kings barbaric pearl
and gold‚’ so 2, 2, 153 3, 3, ¹13 4, 2, 19; Propert. r, 8, 39; 1, 14, 11; 3, 4,
1; Seneca, Thyestes, 371; etc. In this way, of course, an Easteru campaign
is suggested, and we are thus prepared for the following distich. These pre-
lirninary hints are characteristic of Tibullus-potiusque: see note on com·
posuitque, 1, 40. que really connects auri and smaragdi.

52. The thought isa commouplace of the elegy and of all erotic poetry,
1, 2, 65—78 n.; Propert. 3, 2ο, 1-4, ‘durus qui lucro potuit mutare pu·
ellam! Ι tantine ut lacrimes Africa tota fuirr’ Hence the parting scene
here suggested is another regular theme of the elegy, 1, 3, 9 f.; Ovid, Rem.
Amor. 213 f.. etc-vias: refers, as shown by 49-50, to journeys by sea as
well as by land. On nostras for meas see 1, 2, 11 n.

53-54. New motive, war for farne, with which Messalla is naturally aud
gracefully associated, rather than with war for gain.
