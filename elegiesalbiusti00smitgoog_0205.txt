not found in Tibullus, rs the type represented hy Ovid’s well-known line
(Ars Amat. 1, 59) -

quo't caelum stellas, tot habet tua Romapucllas.

This type foreshadows the leonine verses of the Middle Ages, cp. also Introd.
p. 104. The Roman tradition of rhyme is very ancient ; it takes us back at
once to charms, saws, and old said sooth; hence, when used deliberately by
the classical poets it not infrequently echoes more or less faithfully t te antique
and popular sphere in which it had been rooted from time immemorial, cp.
Varro, De Re Rust. 1, 2, 27 (old charm), ‘terra pestem teneto, salus hic
“ maneto’; Verg. E. 8, 80, ‘limus ut hic durescit et haec ut cera liquescit,' etc.,
etc. Note, however, that rhyme was merely a rhetorical figure, and like any

' other rhetorical figure, to be used occasionally in either poetry or prose ; not

until after the loss of feeling for quantity does it become either a charac-
teristic or a determinant of poetic art as such. See Pietro Rasi, ‘Omeoteleuto
Latino‚' Atti e Memorie della R. Accademia di Padova, vol. 7 (1891);
E. Wolffin, ALL. 1, 3 50-3893 especially, E. Norden, Die Antike K unstprosa,
2, 810-883‚ with references.

Ι 55-56. Third, last, and (rhetorically) principal reason for staying at home,
·1 am in love and therefore cannot go.¹ The pentameter is a rhetorical
amplification of the hexameter, see 44 n.

55. formosae vincla puellae: another recognition of the tyranny of love
(cp. dominam, 46 n.) which is often found, 1, 9, 793 2, 4, 1-6; 4, 5, 143
Ovid, Her. 20, 85, ‘sed neque compedibus nec me compesce catenis: Ι servabor
firmo vinctus amore tui'; Rem. Amor. 2133 Fast. 4, ²245 Verg. A. 8, 394;

Catuli. 61, 33; Hor. Oa'. ι, 33, ι4; etc. ‘And thy white arms shall be as y

bands to me Ι Wherein are mighty lordships forfelted.' ·.· Chapman. .

56. sedeur of waiting at a door, 1, 3, 303 cp. 1, 5, 71 and 4, 4,18.— ¹
duras: i.e. hard-hearted, unfeeling, because the door will not open and let
him in. Personification of the house door is regular in this connection.-
iunitor: under the Republic the doorkeeper (always a slave) was chained to
his place, cp. Sueton. De Rhea 3, ‘L. Voltacillus Pilutus servisse dicitur atque
etiam ostiarius vetere more in catena fuisse '; so Ovid addresses him, Amor.
1, 6, r, ‘Ianitor, indignum, dura religate catena, Ι difficilem moto cardine
pande forem’3 hence, the reference here in vincla (55) and the point of the
poet’s half-humorous description of his parlous state. The lover haunts the
closed door of his mistress (Introd. p. 45), as a matter of course. '

57. laudari: i.e. as a soldier. He is thinking of Messalla in 5354.-
Delia: Introd. p. 44. Note especially the arrangement and development of
the thought in the four distichs, 51-58. The poet works up to the mention
