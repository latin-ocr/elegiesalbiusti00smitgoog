NOh'ES [2, 5, ⁶3

in Quintus Smyrnaeus, 2, 665, τῆς tt’ttpa Πληιάδες πρότεραι ἴσαν· ι) δὲ rul
αὑτὴ Ι αἰθερίας ὤιξε πύλας, ἐκέδασσε δ’ᾶρ’ ἀχλύν. The idea, however, is very
old, cp. eg. Ludwig, Ray Veda, 2, 15.

ῦο. amnis: i.e. Oceanus, the Homeric Ocean Stream surrounding the
earth, ΙΙ, 14, 2455 Odyss. 11, 639, etc. The poets habitually return to this
conception (Verg. G. 4, 2333 Ovid, Met. 1, 303 Fasti, 5, 82, etc.), and esp. in
this connection, since all the old totk ideas oi sunrise and sunset presuppose it.

The Sun and his steeds rise lrom Oceanus at dawn (Odyss. 3, 1, etc.), and
in so doing are bathed in his tite-giving waters (Aisch. frag. 192 N., ete).
At evening he siuks κατὰ χθονὸς Ὠκεανόνδε (Hom. Hymn to Hermes, 68)
and he and his steeds are again bathed, as here, cp. Stat. Theb. 3, 407;
Nonnos,12,1;etc. He enters the realm of darkness by the Getes oi the
Suu, Ἠελίοιο πύλαι (Odyss.24,12),and there beyond tbe Ocean Stream is
set the Φοίβου παλαιὸς Κῆπος (Soph. frag. 870 N.), the ancient Garden os
the Sun,'which is the same as the Garden of the Hesperides (Mimnermus,
ιι Cras). Some put it ιο the east, some to the west, but this is immaterial, ior
the Suu has two abiding places (Seneca, Herc. Oct. 2, etc.), one in the east
arrd one in the west, and in each os them his horses rest and are t'ed
(Eurip. frag. 771 N.; Alkest. 5923 Ovid, Met. 4, 214, etc.), The ques·
tion oi bis return to the east was answered by the story oi the ‘Cup ol'
tbe Sun’ (passages collected in Athenaios, ιι, 468-470). Αι sunset he and
his horses enter the golden cup made sor him by Hephaistos, and all night long
they are on the Ocean Stream sailing back again to the east (Stesicb. 6Crus.).

σι. sa: ie. Rome, the reincarnation of Troy, cp. Propert. 4, 1, 53,
‘vertite equum, Danai, male vincitis! Ilia tellus Ι vivet, et huic cineri Iup-
piter arma dabit,’ and 87, ‘Troia cades, et Troica Roma resurges? One ol
the primary conceptions os the Aeneid.

⁶2. Cp. Propert. 4, t, 39, ‘huc melius profugos misisti, Troia, Penates’;
Hor. Carm. Sacc. 37, ‘Roma si vestrum est opus Iliaeque Ι litus Etruscum
tenuere turmae, Ι iussa pars mutare Lares et urbem Ι sospite cursu, Ι cui per
ardentem sine fraude Troiaml castus 'Aeneas patriae superstes Ι liberum
munivit iter, daturus} plura relictis’ Lit. ‘you (tle. Aeneas and his com·
panions) were oi good counsel in so long a journey,' ale. ‘were wisc to take
so long a journey? via is an ablat. oi specification.

⁶3. ueras: ιζι. ιο Apollo. The idea that chewing the leaves ol the laurel

brings about the condition oi inspiration (poetic or prophetie) is very old, cp. ,

Soph. frag. 811 N., δάφνην φαγὼν ὀδόντι πρῖε τὸ στόμα· Schol. on Hesiod,
Theog. 30, ι) δάφνη ἐνεργεῖ πρὸς τοὺς ἐνθυσιασμούς· Lykophron, 6, δαφνηφάγιιι
= one inspired, upon which the Schol. remarks, εἰώθασιν ot μάντεις δάφναι
προεσθιιιν Lukian, Bis Arcus. 1.
