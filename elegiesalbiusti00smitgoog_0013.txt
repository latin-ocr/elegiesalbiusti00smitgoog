PREFACE

ierred to the Notes. The section ooncemed ivith the in·
¹ liuence of Tibullus upon the literatures ol Modern Europe

ι is a mere sketch derived in large part lrom my own read-
ing. Prolonged and intelligent investigation is necessary

before the picture can be completed. Ι trust however ·

that I have outlined it with a fair degree ol accuracy.

It will be observed perhaps that my critique ol Tibullus
runs counter to some discussions of his art and some esti·
mates oi his genius which just at present would appear to
be generally accepted. It was considered however with
the utmost care, and as yet Ι see no reason ior revising it
in any essential particular. In this connection· should be
mentioned two articles (R. Btirger, Baitra'ga aar Elegantia
Τ a'bulls, and M. Pohlenz, Dia Hellanistisclte Paasz'a und die
Philosophia) in the recent volume ol studies to Professor
Leo (Χάριτες Friedrich Lea zum Scalazagstan Geburtstag
dargebraclzt, Berlin, 1911). Ι should have been glad to
consider these, but when they came to my hands the In·
troduction was already in final proof and no further changes
could be made. Blirger's discussion is acomplete justifica-
tion of the illuminating statement ol Plessis (La Palsia
Latine, p. 354, see my Introduction, p. 68) that Tibullus
belonged, in taste if not in lact, to the Attic School.
Pohlenz's discussion of Philetas (pp. 108-112) cannot be
ignored by those who assert that erotic elegy oi the sub
jective type was unknown to the Alexandrian poets.

In the preparation of the Notes I have not hesitated to
avail myseli of whatever appeared to be of value, and it
is possible that through inadvertence Ι may have failed
in some cases to give credit to whom credit was due. I
hope however that special obligations have always re·
ceived special acknowledgment. The scope and character
