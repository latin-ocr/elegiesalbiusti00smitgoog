r, 9, ιι] TlBVLLVS

11-12. 1,4‚67; 1, 6, 533 2,4,4o; Propert.2,16,43; etc. See Wheeler,
Class. Phil. 6, 68.

11. muneribus captus, etc. r the parallelism with‘lucra petens . . . lucra
petituras’ above is obvious. Thus the poet suggests by mere juxtaposition
that Marathus is no exception to the rule, and at the same time we are now
ready lor the natural and apparently anstudiedtransition· (⁴ at deus . . . aquas ')
to the next topic.

ιο. cinerem at aquas: an evidently popular curse upon ill-gotten gain
which suggests that the old folk tale of ‘ fairy gold' was as familiar to the
ancients as it is to us, cp. Ovid, Amor. 3, 8, 66, ‘o si neclecti quisquam deus
ultor amantis Ι tam male quaesitas pulvere mutet opes'; Propert. 2, 16, 43,
‘sed quascumque tihi vestes, quoscumque smaragdos Ι quosve dedit flavo
lumine chrysolithos, Ι haec videam rapidas in vanum ferre procellas, Ι quae tibi
terra velim, quae tibi fiat aqua,’ where the last line appears to be an echo
Ι of Homer, Il. 7, 99, ἀλλ’ ὑμεῖς μὲν πάντες ὕδωρ καὶ γαΐα γένοισθε Ι ἥμενοι
aide ἔκαστοι ἀκήριοι, ἀκλεὲς οὕτως. For variations ep. 49-50 below (‘ fir'e and
water,’ cp. Dirae, 102) ; 2, 4, 40 (⁶ wind and lire '), and the solemn symbol-
ism of 1, 6, 53. Note, however, that in these variations the old element of
marvel disappears, and that in its place we have a substitute suggested ογ the
context and echoing the actual disasters os storm, fire, and flood by which
property is regularly destroyed in the ordinary course of human experienee.
‘Fire, water, woman, are man’s ruin,' as Mat. Prior remarks.

13-16. The point is seen hy comparing 1, 4, 41-5 3 (the services of the

· love'r), i.e. the boy’s punishment may he safely left to the senex himself since

the old brute will insist upon having him with him at all times. Note that
here as elsewhere (cp. eg. 1, 6, 5 3-54 n.) the poet selects a punishment to fit
the crime. The οογ isan example of vulgar greed, he is therefore cursed
with the loss of his ill-gotten gain; he is inordinately vain of his personal
appearance, he is therefore threatened with the loss of his beauty through
excessive toil and suffering. Then too the poet naturally dwells upon the
beauty of his former favourite, cp 1, 8, 6811.

14. etventis ¹. . . coma: 1, 8, 9-10 n. The whole phraseisthe second
subject of detrahet.

15. matur . . . urantur sole: sole goes with both. For this arrangement
c.1, 1, n.
pFor theffhnaphora with change of stress cp. 1, 8, 13 n, and for the thought,
Nemes. 4, 45, ‘tu quoque, saeve puer, niveum ne perde colorem isole suh
hoc,’etc.

16. As if addressing a woman, cp. Propert. 1, 8, 8, ‘tu pedibus teneris
positas fulcire pruinas, Ι tu potes insolitas, Cynthia, ferre nives'; Verg. E.
