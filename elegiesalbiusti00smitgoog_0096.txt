VII. THE POET‘S ART

lt would be impossible in the space at our command to give a
complete conspectus of the formal and stylistic qualities of Tibul-
lus’s poetry. We must therefore content ourselves witha brief
treatment of a few important points suggested by the general
statements already made in the preceding pages For further de·
tails the student is referred to the notes.

One of the most characteristic and important features of
Tibullus’s poetic art is his method of developing his theme.
Mindful of the artistic simplicity belonging to his own peculiar
type, he arranges his topics so skilfully and associates them by
transitions so natural and unatiected, that all idea of artifice or of
a deliberate· scheme disappears in the mere pleasure of reading.
As soon however as under the leadership of Vahlen and Ικεοι we
begin to consider these masterpieces of composition as they are
instead of as they were, aster they had been disfigured by the
transpositions of Scaliger and the doctrinaires of ‘strophic arrange-

ment,’ we perceive that, as Sellar puts it, ‘there is at once unity
and variety in every elegy-the unity of a dominant sentiment,
the variety of thoughts and pictures in keeping with it, arranged
in groups corresponding with one another, and succeeding one an·

the perils of war and foreign adventure and the ideal happiness of
the Saturnian Age. From these perils he passes to the thought of
his own imminent danger, and from that to describe the joys of the
