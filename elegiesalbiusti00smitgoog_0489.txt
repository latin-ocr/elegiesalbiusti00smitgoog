a, 6, 25] TIBVLLVS

as-ao. Ovid,'Pont. r, 6, 31-32 (quoted in 19-28 n.); Anti. Lat. 415, 21,
‘captivus duras illa solante catenas Ι perfert et victus vincere posse putat; Ι
noxius infami districtus stipite membra Ι sperat et a fixa posse redire cruce. Ι
spem iussus praebere caput paloque ligatus, Ι curn micat ante oculos stricta
securis habet. Ι sperat et in saeva victus gladiator harena, Ι sit licet infesto
pollice turba minax: Ι et· cui descendit iugulato in pectora mucro, Ι spem
quamvis lecto iarn reseratur habet. Ι spem recipit carcer foribus praeclusos
aenis, Ι spes et in horrendo robore parva manet,’ etc.

In 1, 7, 42, of which this distich is merely a variant, the slave is cheered
not by hope but by wine. The allusion in both passages arrd also in Ovid,
l.c., seems to beto the common practice at the time ot' working the latifundia
(2, 3, 41-42 n.) with gangs of slaves in chains. ’

as. compede: 1, 7, 42 n.

ao. eed anit inter opus: 2, 1, 66 n. Varro, Sat. Men. 363 Β, ‘homines
rusticos in vindemia incondita cantare, sarcinatrices in machinis’3 Marius
’ Victor. 6, 122 K. speaks oi the songs ot' the Calabrian shepherds; and Ante.
Lat. 388 a, R. is a boatman’s song from a Berlin MS. ot the seventh to the
eighth century. lt begins:

Heia, viri, nostrum reboans echo sonet heial
arbiter effusi late maris ore sereno

placatum stravit pelagus posuitque procellam,
edomitique vago sederunt pondere fluctus.

heia, viri, nostrum reboans echo sonet heia! etc.

It has often been remarked that the ltalians no longer sing at their work as
they did even les's than a generation ago.

27-28. ln this distich (the real motive t'or the digression on hope) the
poet plays on the literary and popular tradition ol the eternal conflict between
the goddess Nemesis and the goddess Elpis or Spes, cp. Introd. p. 53, and
Anti. Pal. 9, 146, Ἐλπίδα καὶ Νέμεσιν Εὔνους παρὰ βωμὸν ἔτευξα, Ι τὴνμὲν
ir’ ἐλπίζῃς· τὴν δ’ ἵνα μηδὲν ἔχῃς.

28. ne vincas: the comic poeta used the second pers. sing. present oi the
optative subjunctive when addressing a definite person. In the classical
period this is rare and poetic. The remaining exx. in Tib. are 1, 6, 75 and 1,
8, 29. Otherwise tlre use may be explained in one of two ways-the definite
person represents a type as in 1, 4, 41 (perhaps, too, 1, 6, 75), or the sentence
is elliptical.—deam: there were several temples to Spes in Rome. Tne
oldest and most important stood in the Forum Holitorium. It was built by
Atssius Calatinus aiter the First Punic War, burned in 31 tae„ restored by
Germanicus in 17 an.
