aurum: Ι carmina quam tribuent lama perennis erit,' hence the regret os Pro·
pentius on parting with Cynthia, 3, 24, 4, ‘versibus insignem te pudet ‚esse
meis! Olten with exempla, as Propert. 3, 2,15 (Pyramids, Temple os Zeus at
Elis, Mausoleum), etc.

63. Nisi coma: for the detailed story of Nisus see diett. His daughter
. was Scylla, and the story of the loss ol his purple lock accounted sor her meta·
morphosis. The Latin parallel is Tarpeia and Tatius as told by Propertius,
4, 4. The story ol Nisus was especially popular during 'and after the Alex.
. Age, and constantly mentioned. Nemesianus, Cyneget. 44 mentions it asa
trite subject. It was told by Parthenios in his Metamorphoses, and by Kalli-
' machos, probably in the Attia. Among surviving versions are the Ciris and
Ovid, Met. 8, 1-151, cp. Amor. 3, 12, 21, Verg. G. 1, 405.-sint ...
nituisset: essent or fuissent. . . nitrea'sset would have been usual. But ‘the
Ideal is not controlled by impossibility or improbability, and the lively lancy
of the Roman often employa the Ideal where we should expect the Unreal'
(Gild.·Lodge, 596, R. 1), eg. ‘tu si bic sis aliter sentias,’ Ter. Andria, 310.
More characteristic of early Latin, but occasional in all styles in the later lan-
guage. To the same liveliness οἰ fancy is due the shift of conception from
ideal to unreal in the same sentence, as here. The only remaining ex. in
the elegy is 1, 8, 22. Others are Plaut. Aul. 5233 Lucret. 5, 2763 1, 3563
2, 1033; Catuli. 6, 23 Verg. G. 4, 116-123; A. 8, 5683 Cicero, Dio. 2, 1223
Fin. 4,61; Livy, 6, 40, 173 Seneca, Herc. Oet. 13853 Mart. 5, ω, 1. Ex-
plained historically by Schmalz, Lat. Stilistt'k, p. 413. For similar exx. of
rapidly shisting fancy see 4, 13, 5, and 2, 4, 7-8.

64. umero Pelopis: see dictt. s.v. Pelops. Appears first in Pindar, Olymp.
1, 40, where the Schol. says that it was also told by Bacchylides. Lukian,
Salt. 54, says that, ἠ Πέλοπος κρεουργία καὶ ὁ ἐλεφάντινος ὦμος αὐτοῦ was a

. favourite theme os the drama, and Vergil, G. 3, 6, mentions it asa trite subject,

‘cui non dictus Hylas puer et Latonia Delos Ι Hippodameque umeroque
Pelops insignis eburno, Ι acer equis?’ Told by Ovid, Met. 6, 403 ; Nonnos, 18,
27z Hyginus, Fut. 83, Dio Chrys. s, 28; Philost. Jmag. 1, 303 Pliny, 28, 34; ¹
Julian, Orat. p. 816.

65-66. Cp. the condition frequently found in old deeds, ‘while wood grows
and water runs.’ These concrete examples ol perpetuity, many of them
popular, and some like these quasi-proverbial, are much developed and
diversified by the poets and rhetoricians,—eg. Verg. A. 1, 607, ‘in freta dum
fluvii current, dum montibus umbrae Ι lustrabunt convexa, polus dum sidera
pascet, Ι semper honos nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt ⁸ ; E. 5, 76 3 Hor.
