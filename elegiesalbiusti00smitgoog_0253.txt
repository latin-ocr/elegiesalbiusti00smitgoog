41. Thotis, no ploughing was done. Agriculture was unknown and un·
necessary. A detail often mentioned iu the development of this topic, cp.

’ 2, 1, 41 n.; ovid, Met. 1,101; Amor. 3, 8, 41, etc. Our poet (cp. 1, 9, 7)

pairs agriculture with navigation as an invention of greed and therefore counts
it as a curse, ‘In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.’ 1t was merely
a step in the natural process of evolution, acc. to the Epicuream, who did
not believe in a Golden Age at all; cp. Lucretius, 5, 933, etc. According
to the Cynics and Stoics, for whom the Golden Age of the past was the ideal
simple life of the past, men subsisted by agriculture alone, i.e. lived a natural
life. Hence, in the version of Aratos which is a revision of Hesiod under
the influence of Stoic doctrine, the clement of marvel has disappeared, and
men are described as peaceful tillers of the soil with no knowledge of civil
strife or of the vexations of the law. Moreover, they were far removed from
the perils of the sea, in those days there were no ships to bring the luxuries
of life from abroad. This version was especially welcome to the Romans, not
only on account of their temperamental Stoicism, but because it agreed more
nearly with their own tradition of early times and with the character and
attributes of Saturn (a god of agriculture and the reputed inventor of the

plough, cp. Macrob. 1, 7, 21; 1,10, 193 etc.) before he was identified with .

the Greek Kronos; cp. 1, ro, 7 f.; Propert. 3, 13, 255 Hor. Epoa'. 2, 2 f. ; etc.

Important here is Verg. G. 1, 121. The primary purpose of this version was ¹

to enhance the dignity of labour. Τὴε history of mankind is divided into two
' periods-the Age of Satum and the Age of Jove. The Golden Age, when
good old Saturn was king, agrees entirely with Hesiod. The second period,

however, is not an age of degeneration, but an age of reform. Jupiter, the ι

divine father of our race and of all our higher aspirations, purposely did away
with the sar niente of the old regime, ‘curis acuens mortalia corda, Ι nec
torpere gravi passus sua regna veterno‚' being well aware that unless men have
difficulties to meet and overcome they can never grow strong in any sense.

ln this characteristically noble conception Vergil has succeeded to a remark· ¹

able extent in meeting the demands of contemporary thought without sacrific-
ing the traditional account of the Golden Age so dear to the poets.

42. That is, people lived naturally and therefore when they moved about
used ‘Shanks his mare,' ‘nullus adhuc erat usus equi: se quisque ferebat,' as
Ovid says, Fast. 2, 297. —frenos momordit: ‘champed the bit,' so Stat. Silo.

Sidonius, Epist. 9, 6, 2. Elsewhere, asin Greek, ‘take the bit in one's teeth’
(either lit. or met), cp. eg. Cic. Fam. 11,23, 2‚‘ si frenum momorderis peream’;

Aisch.Pr0m.1009; Eurip.Hippol.1223; XenEquit. 6, 9, etc. The same ¹

expression for two things so clearly distinguished in English is explained by the
