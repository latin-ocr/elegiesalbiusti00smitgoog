the clearness with which he stated his artistic programme, much
of which is embodied in his own famous saying, μέγα βιβλίον μέγα
κακόν, ae. no long epics, no poems on a large scale and following
the beaten paths, but small pieces characterized by attention to '
detail and artistic perfection - miniatures, as one might say. The
practical demonstration of his views was the Ἑκάλη, a short·
epylliou, and the famous Αίτια, four books of elegies which may
have suggested, at least in some ways, the Fasrt' of Ovid and certain
poems in the last book of Propertius¹

The Κατὰ Λεπτόν of his friend Aratos reminds one of the mis·
cellany by the same name attributed to the youthful Vergil, and in
any case to be closely assuciated with the literary circle of Messalla.

The example oi the Αίτια was followed by Eratosthenes in his
Ἠριγόνγ (Attic aetiological legends). ,

The Θαυμάσια of Philostephanos and such works as the Ὀφιαιιά
of Nikander mark the natural outcome of the Alexandrian Age.

Of the elegies of Euphorion of Chalkis we know nothing except
that according to Diomedes (cp. Probus on Verg. E. 10, 50), they
were imitated by Gallus. The fact however that with the exception
of one uuimportant pentameter the five books of Gallus's elegies to
his Lycoris have completely disappeared makes discussion of this
subject peculiarly unprofitable?

More important, or at all events more definite, is the relation
between Gallus and Parthenios of Nikaia, the last great elegiae

poet of the Alexandrian school. Brought to Rome as aprisoner .

in 73 n.c., but soon after set free, he later became the friend and
teacher of Cornelius Gallus. Parthenios was especially famous for
his Ἐπικήδεια. He also wrote Παίγνια aud epigrammata, which he
dedicated ¹to Krinagoras. In other elegies he told, to quote his
own phrase, ἱστορίαι ξέναι καὶ ἅτριπτοι after the manner of Kalli-
machos and possibly of Euphorion. This was the type recom-

1For the long fragment of Kallimachos (the story of Akontios and Kydippe, to
which¹ as it now appears, Ovid is not as much indebted as was thought) see Gren-
fell and Huni, Oxyrhynchus Ραργνί, Vll, p. 25.
