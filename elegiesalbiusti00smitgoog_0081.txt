TIBVLLVS

thirty-odd years he betrayed so vivid a recollection of six lines in
· the least important piece of an unimportant poet?

Much would be gained if it could be proved that ‘natalem primo ¹
(or ‘primum’), etc, meant ‘the first anniversary of one’s birth,' in
other words that Lygdamus was born in 44, not 43. We could
then agree most heartily with the attractive theory recently taken
up by Plessis (Pobsie latine, p. 364) that Lygdamus was prob
ably none other than the brother of Ovid. Ovid’s brother (Trist.

. 4, ιο, 9 ff.) was born exactly ayear earlier, tle. in 44, which

agrees with the date so gained for Lygdamus; he showed marked
ahility‚ but more especially for the law, which accounts for the
quality of Lygdamus’s verses; he died at the. age of ao, which en-
tirely justifies the reference to youth in Lygd. lines 19-20, and also
explains why Ovid himself returned so often to this particular pas-
sage of six otherwise unimportant verses. Finally, the two boys
were educated together in Rome, and it is reasonable to suppose
that he was, as was his brother Ovid at that time, a member of·
the Messalla circle. Hence the presence of his poems in this
collection. Unfortunately this interpretation of ‘natalem prim0,'
upon which all turus, though reasonable enough in itself, does not
seem to be supported by good parallels in actual Latin usage.
On the whole therefore our best answer to this question is ‘non
liquet’ ¹
The next piece of the collection (4, r) is the so·called Pan-
egyn‘cus Messallae, ahighlylaudatory poem of 212 hexameters, the
date of which (l. 122) has been placed between 31 and 27 rac.
It is now unnecessary to prove that Tibullus was never responsible
for this poem.1 The author is unknown, ,and if Messalla was like

Sulla, he probably gave his enthusiastic panegyrista goodly recom-
pense-on condition that he write no more.²

lTibullian authorship was denied first by Lachmann, Kl. Schr. a. 149. For
