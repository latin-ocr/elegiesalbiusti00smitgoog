nores [1,2‚62

vero urbis nornen etiam doctissimis ignoratum est, caventibus Romanis ne
quod saepe adversus urbes hostium fecisse se noverant idem ipsi quoque hos·
tili evocatione paterentur, si tutelae suae nomen divulgaretur ’; Pliny, 28, 183
3, 65; Plutarch, Quaest.R0m.61,p.279A; Servius on Verg.A. 1, 2773 So·
linus, 1; Lydus, De Mensibus, 4, 73.

58. omnia: for the strong emphasis on omnia due to its position both Ι
at the end of a clause and at the beginning of a verse cp. eg. incipiam in
Verg. A. 2, 13.

59-62. Love, esp. inordinate love, is due to magic (the primitive concep·
tion) and therefore may be removed by magic, cp. Verg. A. 4, 4873 Hor.
Epod. 5, 713 Od. 1, ¹27, 213 Nemes. 4, 62, and osten. Removal of a charm
was olten accomplished by reversing the original ceremony wholly or in part
and repeating it backwards, eg. Ovid‚ Met. 14, 299 (Circe removing her
charm on the companions of Ulysses) ‘spargimur ignotae sucis melioribus
herbae, {percutiturque caput conversae verbere virgae, Ι verbaque dicuntur
dictis contraria verbis‚’ etc. So perhaps to a certain extent iu this charm,
which appears to be a removal of the moon charm. There the rhombos, turbo,
or ‘witches’ wheel,’ wound up the magic thread as it was twirled to the in-
cantation (Theokrit. 2, 30); here the wheel is twirled in the opposite direc-
tion, ae. the charm is unwound‚ cp. Hor. Epod. 17, 7, etc. See also note on
lustravit taedis below.

59. The sudden doubt really amounts to another covert warning, i.e. ‘per-
haps you had better not try the charm at all. 1 am not so sure of the woman’s
infallibility for did she not promise me ? ’ etc. The poet is still haunted by the
unpleasant possibility suggested by 57. -amoresr on the plural, 2, 2, 11 n.

σο. solvere: the idea of binding or constraining is inherent in a charm,
hence solvere, the opposite os vincire, is regularly used in this connection.

61. lustravit taedis: thismethod of removing the ellects of magic is more
fully described by Nemesianus, 4, 62, ‘quid prodest quod me pagani mater
Amyntae Ι tet vittis, ter fronde sacta, ter ture vaporo, Ι incendens vivo crepi-
tantes sulphure lauros, Ι lustravit cineresque aversa effudit in amnem, Ι cum
sicin Meroen totis miser ignibus urar?' On the use of sulphur here, Ovid‚
Rem. Amor. 260, and Tib. 1, 5, 11-12 n.—nocte serena: the moon charm
was tried only when the moon was iuli and visible, cp. Lukian, Philops. 14
(speaking os a magician about to worlr the charm), ὁ δὲ αὐξομένην τηρήσας
τὴν σελήνην-τότε γὰρ ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ τὰ τοιαῦτα τελεσιουργεῖται· Ηυι.
Epod. 5, 513 Theokrit 2, 10, etc. ’

62. magicos deos: the gods invoked hythe magician are more especially
the powers of darkness and of the underworld. The number and method
vary according to the character or solemnity of the charm to be worked.
