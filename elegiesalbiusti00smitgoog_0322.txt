Rome during the first Mithridatic war in accordance with a dream oi Sulla’s
(Plutarch, Sulla, 9). Tibullus is here referring to the Cappadocian goddess.
Her temple in the Flsminisn Circus possessed a grove and some artificial
mounds (CIL. 6, 2232; Tertull. Pall. 4) in imitation os her original Cappa-
docian home. But the statue oi her which Tib. mentions (48) was in her,
new temple, the aedes Bellonae Pulvinensa's, near by. Her service, which
had much in common with that oi Isis and oi the Magna Mater, was in the

hands oia band oi Cappadocian priests, ‘fanatici de aede Bellonae Pulvinen-
sis’ (Juv. 4, ¹²33 CIL. 6, 4903 etc), or ‘Bellouarii’ (Hor. Sat. 2, 3, 223).
Their services in the temple are best described here (the only passage in which
priestesses are mentioned), cp. also CIL. 6, 2233, Lucan, 1, 5653 Juv.·4, 124
and 6, 5113 Minue. Fel. 303 Tertull. Apol. 93 Augustin. C. D. 4, 343 Seneca,
Vit. Beat. 26, 8; Ammian. Marcell. 21, ς. The priests slashed their arms and
shoulders as here, gave each other the blood shed in honour oi the goddess to
drink, and then iell to propbesying amid tbe wild din oi drums and trumpets.
The blood was also scattered over the worshippers who tasted it whenever
possible, as it was supposed to bave puriiying qualities. On boly days they
marched through the streets in much the same manner. Mart. 12, 57,11,
mentions their noisy symptoms oi inspiration among the many hindrances to
sleep in the city, cp. also Tertull. Pall. 4. The nature oi the worship made
it popular with women, especially women oi Delia’s class and calibre, hence
no doubt the choice oi it here, ior this passage is oi course the usual parable
ior Delia's beuefit.

45-49. This sels-inflicted torture is characteristic os the eccentric, orgiastic,
cults oi the highlands oi Asia Minor and will be familiar enough to those who
bave witnessed the ceremonies (cp. esp. 49) marking the debut oi the breves
among our North American Indiam. It is a well-known fact that under such
circumstances a genuine hysterical condition seems to act as an anaesthetic.
Seneca says that the cutting was notas serious as it appeared to be, Dial. 7,
26, 8, ‘cum aliquis secandi lacertos suos artifex bracchia atque humeros sua·
pensa manu (cp. levi, 1, 4, 51 n.) cruentat.’ Commodus (cp. lamprid. 9, 5),a
stickler ior religious iorm wbenever any one could be burt by it, insisted that
the cutting should be deep and genuine.
