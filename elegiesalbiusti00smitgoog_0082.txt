' INTRODUCTION

The next eleven elegies (4, 2-12) on the contrary are by far
the best and the most interesting in the entire collection. They
tell us the charming story os the two young lovers, Sulpicia the
ward and probably the niece os Messalla himself, aud the young
man whom she calls ‘Cerinthus’ The elegies in question are our
only surwiving documents in the case. As Gruppe was the first to
observe, they fall into two groups, 4, 2-6 and 4, 7-12, the first
by some sympathetie poet and friend, the second by the heroine

herself. Each is to a certain extent an independent version oi the .

same story, but the relation os the two is such that both are needed
to complete this romantic chapter in the history os Messalla's own ’
household.

Sulpicia was the daughter of Servius Sulpicius (4, ro, 4), who
was doubtless the son of Cicero's old friend. Is, ¹as seems likely,
her mother (4, 6, 15) was Messalla’s sister Valeria (Hieron. adv.
souin. r, 46), Servius had been dead lor some time, and her uncle‘s
guardianship is explained. We are told that she was beautiful,
we know that she was accomplished and the possessor os remark·

· able literary ability. She also possessed a, large portion and one

os the longest pedigrees in the Empire. A veritable docta puella
and a most attractive young person withal, though considering the
loving care with which she was evidently surrounded and the sact
that she had been reared from childhood in the unconventional
atmosphere os the Messalla circle, itis sair to suspect that she was
somewhat wilful and, let us consess it, a trifle spoiled. At all
events she fell most desperately in love with her Cerinthus; in due
course he returned her affection, and sor some time neither Mes-

salla nor her mother was aware oi the situation. As we shall see ’

presently, the conclusion oi the story is a matter os some doubt.
The first group is introduced by a copy oi verses supposed to
accompanya present to Sulpicia from her friend the poet on the
first os March, the date os the Matronalia. As a tribute os warm
yet purely disinterested regard on a special occasion, this poem
has few equals. Itis hard to believe that there was any member
