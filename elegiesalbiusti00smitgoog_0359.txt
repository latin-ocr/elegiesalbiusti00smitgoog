epitheton,’ as Armado would say, ‘appertaining to Marathus’s young days)
For a similar use ol vetus to bring out tbe particular characteristic ol age
demanded by the context cp. Hor. Epod. 8, 3, ‘curn sit tibi dens ater et rugis
vetus Ι frontem senectus exaret’ ; Ter. Eun. 688, ‘hic est vietus vetus veter·

51. sontica causa3 the sudden appearance ol this unique variant ola
purely technical and very ancient legal phrase ol course adds, as was in-
tended, to tbe evident humour ol' the situation. Α morbus sonticus occurs
in the Twelve Tables as one ol the legal causes lor non-appearance ina
suit, but the essential meaning of sonticus was evidently a matter ol doubt
even among the early commentatore on Roman law. For example, Festus
(ae. Verrius Flaccus) says, p. 290, ‘sonticum morbum in XII significare ait
Aelius Stilo certum cum iusta causa; quem nonnulli putant esse qui noceat,
quod sontes significat nocentes! In other words, Stilo seems to have antici·
pated the modern view ol Clemm, Curtius, Vaniielr, and Brugmaun that sons
(with which ol' course sonticus is connected) is really tbe old pres. participle
ol esse. A morbus sonticus then would be a ‘real, a genuine illness' (and
as such a sufficient excuse lor the sufferer’s lailure to appear). This theory
is not universally accepted (see Walde’s lateinisches Etymologisches Worter·
bucinp. 583, lor modern authorities, tbeories, and discussion), but on the
whole, it is the best explanation ol the later sontica causa. Later Roman
authorities, however, followed unanimously the theory (stated by Festus
above) that sons (on the analogy ol' imonr) = nocens, hence that a morbus
sonticus is an illness injuring or incapacitating the sullerer from appearance,
cp. Festus, p. 111, ‘insons extra culpam, a quo dici morbus quoque existi-
matur sonticus, qui perpetuo noceat'; Lavolenus, Lib. 14 ex Cassio, Digest,
50, 16, 113, ‘morbus sonticus est qui cuique rei nocet'; Iulianus, id. 42, 1,
60, ‘sonticus autem existimandus est, qui cuiusque rei agendae impedimento
est’ ; Gellius, 20, 1, 27, ⁸ morbum vehementiorem . . . legum istarum scriptores
. . . morbum sonticum appellant.’ Hence we have sontica cama, the deriva-
tion and meaning of which is, as Festus himself says (p. 344), ‘a morbo
sontico, propter quem, quod est gerundum, agere nequimus ’ ; and so Naevius,
128 R. ‘sonticam esse oportet causam, quam ob rem perdas mulierem ’;

Cato, frog. Orat. 58 lord. sonticas is glossedby iustas in Paulus, Ex Fert. ἵ

291 M. and the complete disappearance of sontica causa at au early date is
doubtless due to the laet that it was replaced by the regular iusto como,
‘good and sufficient cause‚' cp. 1, 4, 10. Here, however, causa, like atrior, ol
which it is probably a translation, isa technical term ol medicine meaning

the underlying cause ol a disease, cp. Celsus, 1, prooem. p. 3,14, etc, then l
