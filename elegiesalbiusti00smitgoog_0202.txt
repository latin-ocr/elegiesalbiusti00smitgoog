NOTES [1, 1, 49

46. dominam: a recognition ol ‘Tyrannick Lovc' or, as Kraflt-Ebing
would term it, of ‘ Masochismus,¹ which is found the world over. domina isa
slavc¹s word sor ‘the mistress' (hence the lorce ol 2, 3, 793 2, 4, 1 ; Ptopert.
1, 7, 6 and osten in the elegy); it is also used of goddesses (δέσποινα, πότνια,
‘Our Lady'), then os the Empress (Julia Domna, etc), then, as a polite form
ol address, ol any woman, and emerges as such in donna, dome, madame, and
other Rornance derivatives. As here used it appears first in Catullus (68, 68
and ι 56) and then frequently in the elegy. The term was always a compli-
ment in classical times because the original associations ol it were still kept
alive. That it was usual lor girls to return¹ the compliment in addressing
their lovers is shown by Ovid, Amor. 3, 7, 11, ‘et mihi blandities dixit do·
minumque vocavit, Ι et quae praeterea publica verba iuvant’ (“llea, and she
soothed me up, and called me ‘snm-Marione), cp. Ars Amat. 1, 314,
‘et dixit domino cur placet ista meo i’ The affectation ol Greek in this
sphere was especially distastcsul. Martial, 10, 68, 5, eg, chides plain Roman
Laelia with, ‘Kiprenou μέλι μου, ψυχή μου congeris usque, Ι pro pudor, Her-
siliae civis et Egeriae. Ι lectulus has voces, nec lectulus audiat omnis, Ι sed
quem lascivo stravit amica viro!

47-48. With this distich (reallya variation on the preceding) which lor
more than one reader has evoked memories of childhood, cp. Soph. frag.
579 N., φεῦ φεῦ, τί τούτου χάρμα μεῖζυν dr λάβοις Ι τοῦ γῆς ἐπιψαύσαντα κᾷθ’
ὑπὸ στέγῃ Ι πυκνῆς ἀκοῦσαι ψακάδος εὐδούσῃ oper& where present comfort
and salety are heightened by the memory of past dangerand exposure. See
also 1, 2, 78 n. That Tibullus, like Sophokles, was also thinking oi thesea
is shown by the following distich, to which this, in lact, serves as a natural
transition. Johnson translates Tib. in the Rombler, No. 117.

47. fuderit: rutpers. because the ‘gelidae aquae'did not lall and were
not heard until alter Auster had poured them out. For the figure,0vid, Pont.
2, 1, 25, ‘tu mihi narrasti, curn multis lucibus ante Ι fuderit assiduas nubilus
Auster aquas’3 indeed on the Temple of tthinds at Athens, Notus (the Greek
equivalent'of Auster) is represented with an urn, as if in the act of pouring.
The personilication of Auster, as of all winda, is usual in antiquity. Auster is
usually spoken of as rainy or violent; but all winds are cold at times, so
frigidus Auster, Verg. G. 4, 2613 Propert. 2, 26, 363 praefrigidus, Ovid,
Pone. 4, 12, 35.

48. somnos sequi: ‘pursue one's slumbersss ‘go on sleeping,' cp. Soph.
quoted above, πυκνῆς ἀκοῦσαι ψακάδος ebroas, φρενί. For the plur. somnos,
4n.

49-50. The poet again returns to his theme (see Introd. p. 93), and adds
to it the perils ol the deep. For this savourite motive ol antique poetry, see 1,
