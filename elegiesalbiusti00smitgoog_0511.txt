more than once traced to the writer’s incompleta command olliterary form.
The difficulty, however, is not a matter ol inexperience, but amatter os sex.
Sulpicia is a woman, she realizes, as only a woman can, the consequences os
exposure, she dreads them, as only a woman can and should; hence, sor ex·
ample, the intrusion ol fama in the first distich, which constitutes the real
dlfficulty of the first sentence, and which a man would probably not have
used. Nor has she any idea oi running the risk of detection; the subjunctives,
as we have seen, indicate inclination, not intention. On the other hand, is her
love an overpowering passion sor one to whom she is glad and proud to
belong. Here are two master motives. What could be more natural and
more distinctively feminine, especially in a poem intended lor the eyes ol her
lover alone, thau that Sulpicia should measure the depth os her love in terms
ol' her dread οἰ the consequences if it were discovered? She would like, she
tells him, to cast prudence to the winds. If she does not, it is entirely be·
cause she cannot, not because she is ashamed of what she has done; on the
contrary, she glories in it. All this underlies the whole poem, though it does
not come out clearly until the last distich. Apart from this the difficulties
of interpretation as a rule are due to the fact that, womanlike, Sulpicia chose
to state her wishes not as the positive, soto speak, of what she would like to
do, but asa negative ol what she is obliged to do. The underlying thought,
eg, ol 1-2 is, ‘if l told any one,l should bc ruined,' of 5-6, ‘il any one tells
on me, l am ruined,' of 7—8, ‘il' any one at all ever' reads one ol my letters,
Iam ruined’ (the haunting dread ol this thought accounts for the extreme
emphasis ol the negative ‘ne . . . ante’).

Ugo Foscolo (Discorso sul terto del poema di Dante„par. 153), discussing
the fact that Francesca, not Paolo, tells the story of their love, quotes the
first and last distich of our poem and remarks that, ‘Women are not prone

. to tell the secrets oi their hearts; when however their lise, their sair fame,

every thought of their hearts, bas yielded to love alone, then they tell them
freely and with pride. Wheuce it appears to me that these verses have been
justly ascribed to a woman? The citation oi Sulpicia here is not so apposite
as the famous passage (which he also cites) in the letters of Heloise to
Abelard. Foscolo, however, harl an inferior textos the first distich before
him, and he seems to have taken it for granted, as did many of the older
scholars, that Sulpicia here was actually taking the reading public (really or
ostensibly) into her confidence.

7'. tabellis: tablets oi wood coated with wax to receive the impress of the
stylus. One of the most common forms-still used as late as the eigbteenth
century—was the diptych, i.e. two tabellae made to close upon each other¹
like the covers ol their lineal descendant, the solding slate. The diptych
