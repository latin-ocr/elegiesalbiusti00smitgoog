1, 5, 60 n.) because pride is impious and the law is (Cicero, Leg. 2, 22), ⁸ impius

71-76. The sudden and apposite use ol Marathus himself asan example
(to our surprise as to his own) places the elegy in this series and takes us
back to 1, 4, 81 ll. Note that his own sins match point by point the very
ones ol which he has been complaining in Pholoe.

p. 52. The vain and silly little popinjay has been carrying on a secret
intrigue with a horrible old creature whose only possible attraction is his money.
The poet becomes aware ol the situation, taxes the boy with his perfidy,
