INTRODUCI'ION

Α notable feature of Alexandrian literature was the prominence
and popularity of the elegy. Every function os the department
was cultivated and developed by authors whose names were de-
servedly famous in later times. In considering the elegy we must
include also the elegiae epigram. Historieally there is no hard
and fast line between the two.l The elegiae epitaph of Simonides,
for example, which is said to have been developed first by Anak-
reon has been derived from the old threnodie mood of the elegy.
But the characteristic Alexandrian epigram—erotie, sentimental,
ironical, and what-not- of which many examples are preserved in
the Greek Anthology, is even more closely related to the elegy.
In fact it is nothing more nor less than an elegy in miniature and, “

as such, often the artistic development of themes already out-
lined, not only by the Attie poets and Theognis but even by the

old Ionian school. This type of Alexandrian epigram is often¹
imitated and subjected to rhetorical expansion by the Roman
elegiae poete, especially Propertius, but above all Ονίἀ.2

The New elegy was a faithful reflection of the new culture.
The establishment of an imperial system with eontinental pos-
sessions was responsible for pronounced changes in Greek life and
thought. Τὴε new cosmopolitan ideal was strong both for good
and for ill. The outlook of the average man was perhaps wider
and more varied, but the conditions under which the great master-
pieees of the past were produced had disappeared forever. Like
all other private citizens, the poet was no longer concerned with
the polieies of the state. He might attach himself to some court,
and many did so, but in any ease his themes and his inspiration
were now more distinctly those of a cosmopolitan living inan age
os great learning and great intellectual and aesthetic refinement.
