habitually accompanied by one or more linlihoys, cp. eg. Propert. 1,=3‚ 9
’ (coming home late and in his cups), ‘ebria cum multo traherem vestigia
Baccho Ι et quaterent sera nocte facem pueri) Constantly in the elegy as well
as in ‘everyday life the lanternarii, as they were 'called are associated with
illicit love affairs (hence the bitter sneer of Cicero, ln Pison. 20, ‘cum altero
Catilinae lanternario consule ’) whether urged with unnecessary elan by the
roysteringbladc (asin Herondas‚ 2, 69; Hor. Sat. 1,4,49, etc.) or conducted
by an intriguer for whom as here (on account of the girl who is in the usual
situation of the elegiae heroine, cp. lutrod. p. 45) secrecy is a sine qua non.
The office was servile and the wonderful escape of Antonius (Val. Max. 6, 8,
1) merely emphasized the rule that slaves cannot be trusted (cp. eg. lines
25-26 above). By way of precaution, therefore, Tib. had taken the place of
the usual lanternarius. This habit among friends of ‘playing gooseberry’
(for which, by the way, the modern Italian expression is tenere il moccolo,
‘holding the candle’) appears to have been not uncommon, cp. eg. Propert.

41. verbis: i. ι. between Marathus and the girl. For conscius with the
dative see 1, 7, 48 n.

43-44. That is, Marathus goes to her house and the girl, who has already
stolen her way (venii) to the door and iswaiting for him inside, lets him in,
her practical reason being to prevent the necessity of lenocking or of anything
else likely to cause detection. For the same reason, while waiting she con·
ceals herself as much as possible (latuit adoperta) both from those within and
from those who may be without. Her part of the programma is pictured
in such scenes as 1, 2, 18-20 (where see notes) ; 1, 6, 595 2, 1, 753 4, 6, 11.

43. munere: here ‘service,’ ‘favoun’

45. conlisus amari: ‘certain of being loved.' The present infin. with
confido does not hegin until Cicero, cp. eg. Fam. 7, 14, 2, ‘nosque a te amari
cum volumus tum etiam confidimus,’ and was never common afterwards. in
a considerable proportion, even of these cases, confido is followed by posse
witha pres. infin, as eg. in Lucret. 5, 390, ‘confido siccare posse,' and in
Phaed. 1, 18, 6, ‘confido finiri posse,’ the only remaining exx. from the poets
quoted hythe Thesaurus. As, however, posse with the pres. infin. really:
the future infinitive‚ all such examples are not to be included here. Hence,
the Tibullian confisus amari appears to be unique in Latin poetry. For
omission of the subject accus, also unique in this use with confido, cp. 1, 3,
27 n.

4⁶. poteram: 1, 8, 55 n.-ad: i.e. ‘toward’ ‘with regard to.' cautus
with ad is very rare. With the exception of Livy, 24, 32, 3 (not given hythe
Thesaurus, 3, 642, 35 f.) the usage appears only in the very late writers, viz.
