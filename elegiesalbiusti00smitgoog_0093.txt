TIBVLLVS

were to be found in various parts of F rance during this long period
is shown indirectly by contemporary catalogues of libraries long
since lost or dispersed. N one however have survived. Indeed all

our mss. of the complete text appear to be descended directly or
indirectly from a single copy found in the fourteenth century,
transcribed, and then lost.

The oldest and best representative of it, and our principal
authority for the text now before us,is the Ambrosianus (R. 26,

sup.),a ms. of the fourteenth century, which at that time belonged
to Coluccio Salutato. As its name indicates, it is now in the

Ambrosian Library at Milan.
The Vaticanus 3270, belonging early in the fifteenth century, is

closely related to the Ambrosianus, andis next to it in order of
merit. , ·

The Codex Eboracensis‚ dated 1425, to which Lachmann drew
special attention in his edition of 1829, is occasionally of some value.

Other mss. of this family still survive in large numbers, but they
have no independent value, and have all suffered more or less
severely from the corrections and emendations of the various
Italian scholars who from 1370 to 145⁰ were especially interested,
not only in Tibullus, but also in Catullus and Propertius.1

The text of the Ambrosianus however is by no means of the
best, and although we find some traces of an older anda better
tradition, our record of it is only partial. Our most important
representative of it was the so-called Fragmentum Cuiacianum, a

ms. once belonging to the famous jurist Cujas (1522-1590). Un- ·

fortunately it did not begin until 3, 4, 65, and as it is now lost,
our knowledge of it for editorial purposes is limited to a collation
of it made by Scaliger, and entered by him on the margin of his

own copy of the Plantinian Tibullus (1569) now in Leyden. ’

1These men are responsible for the various stop-gaps found in this family of
mss. at the four lacunae in the Corpus Tibullianum (1, a, 252 1, ιο, a6; a, 3,
14 and 75) ; see R. Soldati, Riv. di Filologia, 28, 287.

A late ms. of Ovid and Tibullus (of no value) is reported by E. Gerunzi,
Arenae Roma, No. 66, p. 185.
