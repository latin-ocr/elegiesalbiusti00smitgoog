TIBVLLVS

Gebhardus, etc, iu the variorum os J. G. Graevius (2 vols, Utrecht,
1680), the most notable edition os the seventeenth century.

The great editions oi the eighteenth century are those os Janus·
BroukhusiuS,Amste1dam‚ 1708, and oi J. A. Vulpius, ad edition,

Padua, 1749. Each is furnished witha complete index verborum3
and their commentaries, though characteristically long and wordy,
are mines oi informatiou from which every succeeding editor has
extracted something oi value. The text however was still dom·

- inated more or less by the perniciousiuliuence oiScaliger's wholly .

unwarranted transpositions and redistributions. .

The first really critical edition according to modern standards
was published by Lachmann in 1829. The important annotated
editions ol this period are by J. H. Voss, Heidelberg, 1811 ; I. G.
Huschke, Rostock, 1814 ; Heyne-Wunderlich, 4th edition, Ieipzig,
1817 3 and L. Dissen, Gottingen, 1835. All are oi value, but
Dissen’s is especially noteworthy. He wasa critic ol rare taste
and discrimination3 his introduction has never been entirely
superseded3 and his commentary in spite oi some peculiarities is
still the best complete commentary on Tibullus in modern times.

The text os Lucian Miiller (Teubner, 1870) is marred by his ten·
dency here as elsewhere to transpose aud emend where neither is
necessary. Baehrens’s great service (Teubner, 1878) layin dem-
onstrating the position and value in our textual tradition os the Am-
brosianus.. But he set too high a value 011 the Guelferbytanus ; and
his text, lilre every other text with which he had to do, is marred
by his inveterate habitos drastic and ill-considered emendation.

The best modern texts now available are those by E. Hiller,
, Tauchuitz, 1885, with testimonia and index verborum; by Haupt-
Vahlen, oth edition, Leipzig, 19o4; and J. P. Postgate, for the
Bibliotheca Classica Oxoniensis (1905), aud for the ‘Medici
Society‚’ London, 1910.

The only modern commentaries on the complete Corpus
Tibullianum are by Philippe Martinon, Paris, 18955 and Geyza
Nemethy, Budapest, 1905.
