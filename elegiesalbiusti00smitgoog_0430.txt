NotrEs [2‚ 3, 53

The ancients very properly made much oi a graceiui aud appropriate gait.
Ovid’s advice to women is (Ars Amat. 3, 298) -

discite femineo corpora ferre gradu:

est et in incessu pars nou contempta decoris:
allicit ignotos ille fugatque viros.

haec movet arte latus tunicisque fluentibus auras
accipit extensos fertque superba pedes;

illa velut coniunx Umbri rubicunda mariti
ambulat ingentis varica fertque gradus.

sed sit ut in multis, modus hic quoque: rusticus alter
motus, concesso mollior alter erit.

So in theold epitaph ol Claudia (Carne. Epig. 52 B.) it is recorded that
she was ‘sermone lepido, tum autem incessu commodo’; again in the frag·
ment oi a Greek historiari (FHG. 2, 259) our attention is called to the
graceiul carriage oi the Theben women, al δὲ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν τοῖς medeci,
πορείαις, ῥυθμοῖς οὐσχημονέσταταί τι καί εὐπρεπέσταται τῶν ἐν τῇ Ἐλλάδι
γυναικῶν. For the ‘concesso mollior’ type cp. Propert. 2, 4, 5, ‘nequiquam
perlusa meis unguenta capillis, Ι ibat et expenso planta morata gradu’3
Petrou. 126, ‘incessus arte compositus et ne vestigia quidem pedum extra
mensuram aberrantia'; Catullus, 42, 8, etc-conspicienda: t, 2, 70 n.

53. vester tenues quae femina coa: the first to mention silk in the Occi· ’

dent is Aristotle (De Animal. Hist. 5, 19, 6), and the first time the Romans ever
saw it was in the banners oi the Parthians at Carrhae (Florus, 1, 46, 8). They
never had a general name ior it, but knew it in the three varieties ot' Coa, bom·
by‘cina, and serica. The Coc (ie. from Cos) was made from a local variety ot'
silk-worm which sed on the terebinth (Pliny, ιι, 77). It was enormously
popular at Rome in the time oi Augustus aud until the latter halt oi the first
century nn. (cp. 2,4,29; Propert. 1,2,1; 2, 1, 5; 4, a, 23; 4, 5, 233 Ovid,Ars
Antat. 2, 2983 lior. 0114, 13, 133 etc). It appears to have been very much
like our chilion or ¹ Liberty’ sillr and it was very expensive (Propert. 4, 5, 5⁶³
etc). The general Greek word ior all such garmeuts was the expressive
διαφανῆ (Menand. Fab. Incert. 241, Mein), cp. tenues here; Hor. Sat. 1, 2,
101, ‘Cois tibi paene videre est Ι ut nudam’; Propert. 1, 2, 2, 'et tenuis Coa
veste movere sinus’; Eubulus, 67 K, ἐξὸν θεωρήσαντι πρὸς τὸν ἣλιον l γυμνὰς
ἐφεξῆς ἐπὶ κέρως τεταγμένας Ι ἐν λεπτοπήνοις ὕφεσιν ἑστώσας, οἵας Ι Ἠριδανὸς
. ἁγνοῖς ’ὑδασι κηπεύει κόρας, etc. ‘Coan vestments’ were therefore particularly
allected by the demi-monde, and hence when adopted by iadies oi iashion
were the theme ‘oi numerous denunciations, cp. eg. Seneca, Ben. 7, 9, 5,
‘video sericas vestes, si vestes vocandae sunt, in quibus nihil est quo defendi
aut corpus aut¹ denique pudor possit ; quibus sumptis (mulier) parum liquido
