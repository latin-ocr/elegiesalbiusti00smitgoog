INTRODUCTION

¹ In addition to this we derive occasional help from the mediaeval
florilegia to which reference has already been made. Tbese are
the Excerpta Parisina and the Excerpta F risingensia. The best
representatives of the former are the Parisinus 7647 of the twelfth
or thirteenth century and 17903 of the thirteenth century; of the
latter, the Monacensis 6292 of the eleventh century. Both col-
lections, but especially the Excerpta Parisina, enjoyed a wide
popularity from the eleventh to the fourteenth century, and quota-
tions from Tibullus in the writers of that period, eg. in Vincent de
Beaurais, can usually be traced to one or the other of them. They
are collections for the most part of wise saws aud modern in·
stances, and the editors do not scruple to Bowdlerize. Itis evi-
dent however that the text from which they drew their elegant
extracts was better than that represented by the Ambrosianus.

It was claimed by Baehrens that the Guelferbytanus (fifteenth
century), discovered and collated by him in 1876, actually repre-
sented the text used by the editor of the Excerpta Parisina. The
claim cannot he supported. Rothstein1 for example made it rea·
sonably clear that the points of agreement between this ms. and
· the Excerpta Parisina were due to editorial collation. At the
same time the exact position of the Guelferbytanus in our textual
tradition is not altogether certain.

The first dated edition of Tibullus (also containing Catullus,
Propertius, and the Silvae of Statius) appeared in 2472. The

' commentary of ‘Bemardinus Cyllenius’ appears in the Roman

edition of 1475. It was reprinted in some later editions, and is
still of value. The best edition of the sixteenth century is the
second Aldine of 1515 (the first appeared in 1502) 3 the most ,
famous is Scaliger’s edition of 1577. The best commentary o'f
this period is by Achilles Statius, and it appeared first in the
Venice edition of 1567. It was reprinted along with the notes of Ι
’ the Douzas, the commentaries of Scaliger, Muretus (Venice, 1 544),

100 Tibulli Calbim, Berlin, 1880. A facsimile of g was published by Leo in

1910.
