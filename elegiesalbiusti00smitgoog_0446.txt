NOTES [2, 4, 51

etiam grave erat, nulla mercede hyacinthos Ι inicere et fracto busta piare
cado!

45. That is,‘quae bona fuitnec avara! nec = ‘and . . . not’ or‘ but . . .
not ' is idiomatic, cp. eg. Ter. Eun. 249, ‘est genus hominum qui esse primos
se omnium rerum volunt 1 nec sunt: hos consector’; Cic. Off. 3, 41, ‘quod
utile videbatur neque erat,’ etc. Here perhaps we ma'y best translate by
‘without being.’

4⁶. flebitur: ie. the company, ‘all hands,’ cp. Ter. And. (also of a funeral)
too, ‘funus interim Ι procedit ; sequimur ; ad sepulcrum venimus3 l inignem
impositast; fletur,' etc. It is also implied oi course that the company will be
a large one, rie. as opposed to ‘nec . . . ullus’ (43), ‘not asingle one.’ Note
that the poet’s lively fancy here shists from the fervent wish of ‘eripiant . . .
spectent. . . addat’ to the prophetie certainty ol ‘erit . . . flebitur . ..
dabit . . . dicet! For similar exx. ot' a shiiting point oi view cp. 1, 1, 24 n.

47. atque . . . et: 1,10,23n.-aliquia: here a substantive in apposi-
tion with senior, not an attribute oi it ; hence aliquis, not aliqui, is demanded
(Gildersleeve·1odge, 314, Rem. 1).- veteres veneratus amores: ‘his love
ot‘ other days,’ 'where amores, like our own word love in such a connection,
might mean either his love, cp. 2, 2, 11 n., or the object of it, ae. his sweet·
heart, cp. 1, 6, 35 n. In the former case ‘veteres veneratus amores' would
not be sar from ‘for old sake‘s sake,' in the latter, ‘honouring the memory of
his old sweetheart.' The use of veneratur shows that the latter is meant.

48. annua semar 2, 6, 323 Propert.4‚ 7, 43; Ovid, Fasti, a, 535i. Resides,
the regular parentalia (Feb. 13-21), the anniversary ot‘ the death (parentalia
privata), etc, there were two special ‘Decoration Days’ in May ,οι June,
known as the rosaria and the dies violae, at which this attention might be
, shown. -constructoz the adjective is meant to suggest that the tomb itseli
had been carelully built and taken care ol.

49-50. For this natve and touching wish see 1, 4, 60 n. and cp. the variation
ot' Martial, 5, 34, 9 (on his little slave girl Erotion), ‘mollia non rigidus caespes
tegat ossa, nec illi, Ι Terra, gravis fueris: non tuit illa tibi,’ which is far better
than Meleager’s epigram Etr Αἰσιγένην τινὰ εὐτελῶς βιώσαντα (Anah. Pal. 7,
4⁶¹)-

παμμῆτορ γῆ, χαῖρε· σι) τὸν πάρος οὐ βαρὺν eta σέ
Αἰσιγένην καύτὴ νῦν ἐπέχοις ἀβαρής.

49. Carm. Epr‘g. 541, 12 B, ‘hic ego sepultus iaceo placidusque quiesco,¹
is quoted as an echo os this line.
51-52. The bitter confession brings us back again to the subjectos the

elegy. For the same device cp. 1,4, 81-84 (and n.); ι, 5, 673 1, 5, 353 a, 5, 39.
