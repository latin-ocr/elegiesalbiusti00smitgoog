2, 6, ι] TIBVLLVS

thet Nemesis would be kind; but Nemesis says no. lmpious girl, Hope is a ,

goddess. Would you overrulea goddess? Spare me, I beg, for your dead
sister’s sake. Poor little girl, 1 will talre sanctuary at her tomb, 1 will place
offerings there, and 1 will tell her my wrongs. She will not allow her suppli-
ant to be abused by you all the time. Beware! the neglected dead might
send you evil dreams and your sleep be haunted by your sister's form as she
was when she fell headlong from that lofty window and came all bloody to
the shadow world. Nay, no more, lest my mistress’s bitter grief be ronsed
anew. What arnI thet she should spoil those speaking eyes with one tear
for me. 'Tis the lena who is to blame, the girl is good. How often have Ι
cursed the bag. May every curse come to pass! '

¹·4· This picture-which reminds one of a Hellenistic fresco-is more
Alexandrian in tone and manner thau is usual with Tibullus. ¹

r. castra sequitur: asse. ‘serve in the army,' ‘be off to the wars’; not un-
common esp. iu poetry, cp. Propert. 2, 10, 19, ovid, Amor. 3, 8, 265 Pont.

2, 2, 11; Met. 5, 128; Lucan, 10, 407 ; etc-Macer: the identity of this η

friend of Tibullus is not certain. The poem tells us that he was starting on a
campaign, and lines ι and 5 suggest that he may have been an elegiae poet.
There were at least two Macers in this period aud both were poets. It is
most probable‚ however, that Tibullus refers to Aemilius Macer of Verona, a
friend of Vergil (Philargyrius on E. 5, ι) and of Ovid (Trist. 4, ιο, 43) and
the author of several didactic poems (Ornithogenia,· Theriaca,· De Herbis)
which were long famous. Hieronymus telis us that he died in Asia Minor
ιιι 16 tae. This was perhaps during a military campaign and possibly the
very campaign for which he was starting when this elegy was written.-
quid flet: ‘what will become of, happen to.’ This use of fieri with the dative
is found iu all styles and periods. The point of the question is that aster all
Cupid isessentially a god of peace and ease, cp. 53 Propert. 3, 5, 15 esp. Ovid,
Rem. Amor. 136 f.

a. sit . . . gerat: the question is rhetorical and the potential (ι, 6, 74η.)
serves to suggest a negative answer on the part of the poet- and we agree

with him as soon as we too get the vision of that little figure loaded down =

with the heavy equipment of a Roman infantry soldier (⁴ iniusto sub fasce’-
Verg. G. 3, 347) and trndging along all day beside his friend ‘non passibus
aequis! For the omission of en interrogative particle cp. 1, 9, 69.—collo‚
etc: Plautus, Trin. 595, ‘actumst de collo meo, Ι gestandust peregre clu·
peus, galea, sarcina' Cp. the proverbial ‘ collo suo ligna portare' (Petron. 38).
We should say ‘shoulders, ’or ‘baele’

3. longa via: r, ι, 26 n.-vaga aequora: rte. ‘shilting’ asin 2,3, 395
