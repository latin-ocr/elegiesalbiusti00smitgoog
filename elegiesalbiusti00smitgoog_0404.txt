ripening os their wine, sealed the jars caresully and placed them where the ’
heat of the hearth lire could reacb them. lls a matter os course, the smolre
reached thern also. fumosos, which is therefore suggestive oi age, applies
to the appearance oi tbe jar, and also to the taste oi the wine. ln the
Augustan Age this smoky flavour, as in our own time the ‘reek' of Scotch
wbisky (originally due to the same cause), was much admired; cp. Columella,
1, 6, 2ο, ‘apothecae recte superponuntur his locis unde plerumque fumus
exoritur: quoniam vina celerius vetustescunt quae sumi quodam tenore
praecocem maturitatem trabunt) In Martial's time ( 10, 36) the reelr was
less admired, owing to the fact that the vintners οἰ Gaul, and esp. of Marseilles,
bad long been flooding the marlret with inferior wines to which this method

of development had been applied with too great raptura-veteris consulis: ·

wine was dated by the name oi the consul lor the year in which it was made,
cp. Hor. Od. 3, 21, 13 3, 8, 93 etc. Hence vinum consulare in Martial’s time
corresponded in value and rarity to old Madeira of the twenties and thirties
in our day.

Varro, De Re Rust. 1, 65, writing in Cicero‘s time, classes Falernian among
those wines ¹ quae quanto pluris annos condita habuerunt tanto curn prompta
sunt fructuosiora! Pliny, however, was a lar better judge, ior writing a lull
century later he says (23, 34) oi Falernian that ‘media eius aetas a XV annis
incipit’; cp. als0, Athen. 26 C. In that case Tibullus’s fine old Falernian
would hardly be old enough to remember Caesar's campaigns in Gaul.

Chian was a mild vintage osten mixed at table with the somewhat strong
and heady Falernian, cp. Hor. Sat. 1, 10, 24, ‘suavior ut Chio nota si com·
mixta Falerni est’; Pliny, 14, 97; ete-Falernos: supply cados from cado
below. .

28. servite vincla: Schulze compares Archil. 4, 2 Crus. κοίλων πώματ’
ἄφελκε κάδων, and Theokrit. 7, 147, πίθων ἀπελύετο κρατὸς ἄλειφαρ. For the
simple ablative, cado, cp. 2, 1, 7 and note.

29-30. For the sentiment and point of view see 1,1o, 51-52; 2, 5, 873
Ovid, Fasti, 3, 539, above; Livy, 40, 14, 1, ‘non est res qua erubescam,
pater, si die sesto inter aequales largiore vinosum usns'; Macrob. 1, 11, 39,
‘viros plurimo vino provocaverunt diem lestum apud se esse simulantes!

30. errantes et male terre pedes: Volpi (1749) translates by the expressive
Italian phrase andare a spinapesche, ‘walking d la herring-bone (stitch).’

31. bene Messallam: sc. valere iubeo, so Plaut. Stich. 709; Ovid, Fasti,
2, 637, etc. With the dative, as cg. Ovid, Ars Amat. 1, 601, ‘et “ bene '' die
‘¹ dominae,'’' rit is to be supplied (ii anytbing).-sua ad pocula: a good
English parallel sor ad here is the use oi ‘at’ in expressions oi time, eg. ‘at
ten o’clock‚’ ae. when it is or was ten 0’cloclr. Hence ad sua pocula dicatis
