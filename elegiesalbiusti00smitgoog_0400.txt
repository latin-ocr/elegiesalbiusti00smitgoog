5-6. Cp. Ovid, Fasti, 1, 665, quoted above. The antique plough was so
light that it could be and regularly was hung up when not 111 use. Α The same
thing may still be seen in the remoter districts oi Italy, but it is now rapidly
disappearing.

7-8. The oxen, being sacred to Ceres (Varro, Dc Re Rust. 2, 5, 4, eto),
always had these privileges at the Ambarvalia. In the same way the mules
had their ‘day off’ at the Consualia (Dionys. Hal. 1, 33, etc.), and on the day
sacred to Vesta the ass that turned the mill rested from his toil (Propert. 4, 1,
213 Ovid, Fasti, 6, 311 ; lactant. 1, 21, 26; etc.). Plutarch, Mor. 276, calls
especial attention to this pretty custom. ¹

7. iugis: the simple ablative with solvere is uncommon, cp. Verg. A. 1, 562
(echoed by Sil. Ital. 12, 324) ; Ovid, Ars Amat. 2, 237 ; Phaed. 3, 7, 20; etc. ,
Cp. 28 n.

ι 9-86. These lines and 2, 3, 1-10 212 imitated by Bertin in his Amours, 3, 5.

9. audeat imposuisse: the pers. infin. with audeo is very rare. The
Thes. quotes only Lucan, 1, 258; 8, 552 ; Statius, Theb. 12, 101 ; Ammian.
Marcell. 14, 5, 6; 27, 2, 9 ; 28,1,14; Macrob. 5,1,4,211(1 omits this
example. All are perfect forms ol audeo as well except Lucan, 8, 552;
Macrob. l.c. The derivation ot' audeo (cp. avidus) suggests that the cons. is
due to the analogy of verbs of wishing, esp. velle and nolle, which often take
peri. infin„ cp. 1, 1, 29-32 n. Note that in all the exx. above cited the peri.
is emphatic. —nonr to be taken with ulla (=nulla) rather than audeat
(potential).-ulla: subst, see 1, 6, 69 n.

10. Auson. 15, 4, 4, ‘fama pudicitiae lanificaeque mauus'; 15, 18, 4,
‘morigerae uxoris lanificaeque manus‚' 212 quoted as echoes of this line.

12. Traces of restrictione like this are to be found all over the world, see
Fehrle, p. 65 (l. c. 2, 5, 64 n.)-cui: lor incorporation of the antecedent cp. 1,
2.13; 11, 653 1‚s.35; ²‚1‚792nd80; 2. 3. 31-

13-14· Quoted on the title page ol the first edition of Englaud’s Helicon
(1600).

13. casta placent superis: sums up the details ol 11-14 just as‘ omnia ,
sint operata deo‘ (9) sums up the details ol 5-1ο. 011 ‘pura cum veste ’ and
‘manibus puris' see 1, 3, 25 114 Hesiod, W. aud D. 724; Soph. 0. K.
469; 212.

15-16. The procession to the altar. The sacer agnus (‘ambarvalis,’ cp.
Macrob. 3, 5, 7) had previously been thrice led around the poet’s estate, cp.
eg. Verg. G. 1, 345, 'terque novas circum felix eat hostia fruges, Ι omnis quam
chorus et socii comitentur ovantes 1 21 Cererem clamore vocent in tecta!
The poet omits it here because too much detail would have detracted lrorn
the artistic effect. Τ112 lamb was led by a loose rope (Juv. 12, 53 Servius
