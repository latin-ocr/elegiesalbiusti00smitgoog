are numerous, cp. eg. TheTrueTrojans‚1,1(Dodsley's Old Plays, XII,
p. 453), ‘Hang up thy rusty helmet, that the bee 1 May have a hive, or
spiders find a loom’ Here, too, should be included Mustard’s citatione from
the ‘sonnet’ appended to Peele's Polyhymnia, ‘His helmet now shall make
a hive for bees,’ and Lyly's Campaspe, 4, 3, ¹ Bees to make their hives in sol·
